# **FAQs**

# **WHITEPAPER TL;DR**

1. Access to AI has become fundamental to modern life. 
2. Large centralized companies currently gate keep access to AI, they actively restrict access & use censorship.
3. Having a personal AI that is open source, decentralized, and permissionless fixes this. 
4. Morpheus provides users a decentralized, permissionless, personal AI. 
5. Decentralized, permissionless financial rails is also required for true AI freedom. 
6. Morpheus uses crypto-based financial rails to reward AI & Smart Agent providers. 
7. Follow the white rabbit. Free your mind.

# **FAIR LAUNCH**
1. There is no pre-mine, no token sale, and no private sale. All earning of MOR rewards start at the same time.
2. Proposed date February 8th 2024 (depends on audits) for Smart Contracts to move to Ethereum mainnet.
3. Boot strap period goes for 90 days, MOR tokens are only claimable on day 91.
4. stETH can be deposited and withdrawn during the bootstrap period after 7 days of lockup.
5. Only Capital and Code rewards go live in Phase one. 
6. Compute rewards start in Phase two. 
7. Community (front end builders and smart agents) rewards start in Phase three.

# **GENERAL QUESTIONS**

**What is Morpheus?**
Morpheus is a Decentralized AI network and local inference. 

**Who are the founders?**
The anonymous authors of the paper are Morpheus, Trinity and Neo. They published the paper September 2nd 2023. 

 **Who is on the team?**
There is no formal team, company or Foundation. Morpheus is fully decentralized and community driven.

**How can I contribute?**

**Who can I contact regarding cooperation/marketing proposals?**
 You don't need anyone's permission to talk about Morpheus or add value as a Contributor. It's all built in public.

**Where can I get more information about Morpheus?**
This FAQ is the best start and Morpheus Whitepaper next https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/WhitePaper.md

**How do I contribute to be considered part of the Morpheus community?**

**What is a Smart Agent?**
Smart Agent is a term to describe a general purpose AI that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user using LLM transformer language that converts human language into actionable code for Web3 interactions using intent based abstractions.

**How does Morpheus make it technically possible that everyone can run the assistant on their own computer?**
Think of Morpheus as the base layer 0 for the agents to be able to interact across Web3 in a Decentralized fashion. Like what Google search was to the internet in the 90's it allows an aggregation of and accessible to all the Web3 on-chain activity through a Smart Agent controlled by the user that is familiar with them. This in turn should reduce the friction for all users, crypto native and retail, when interacting in the space where everything is currently siloed with a large barrier to entry. While there is no chain for Morpheus itself for people to build dapps on (Yet) it will allow users freedom of accessibility in the space that hasn't been possible before.

**Are there any plans for Morpheus to have its own chain in the future?**
At the moment, there are no such plans, but it's not ruled out in the future.

**Why did you choose Ethereum and Arbitrum for the launch?**
Ethereum security and capital wise. Pool of stETH was found to be greatest on Arbitrum as well as cheap transaction costs which is vital for using MOR to pay for inference of AI models.

# **MOR TOKEN AND LIQUIDITY**

 **What is MOR?**
MOR is the underlying token of the Morpheus network.

**What is the utility of MOR?**
MOR is the token that will be used to obtain the IPS (Inference Per Second) required to interact with the Smart Agents

**How/where can I buy tokens?**
You will be able to purchase MOR token ONLY after a 90-day of bootstrapping period (tentatively May 9th). A liquidity pool will be created on the Uniswap for Arbitrum for this purpose.

**Can I know more about tokenomics?**
42 Million MOR is the max supply that will ever exist.
Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day and decreases to 0 per day by year 16.
3,456 MOR per day for Capital Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Code Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Compute Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Community Providers.

**How do I earn MOR?**
By providing one of the 4C's:
- Capital
- Code 
- Community 
- Compute

**How many phases is the MOR earning categorized into?**
Phase 1: Code & Capital
Phase 2: Compute
Phase 3: Community

**Where will the AMM liquidity pool be created?**
Uniswap on Arbitrum chain with wstETH/MOR pair and likely on on Etherium as well

**How will the initial liquidity be created?** 
51,444 MOR tokens by day 90 dedicated to the protection fund and leveraged for bootstrapping purpose will be paired with yield generated from deposited stETH and put into AMM liquidity pool.

**What is the initial price of the MOR token? What will be the market—Åap/FDV of the MOR token?**
It‚Äôs unpredictable as it entirely depends on the volume of stETH deposited during the bootstrap period. 

**What is Protocol Owned Liquidity? **
The yield of stETH contributed stays in the Morpheus protocol and adds depth to Uniswap and similar pools so that MOR becomes more liquid over time.

# **BOOTSTRAPPING PERIOD** 

What is the purpose of the bootstrapping period?
This period will ensure enough MOR tokens are ready for circulation to fulfill the utility functions of the network, thus avoiding extreme token scarcity and extreme market volatility.

**What is the duration of this period?**
90 days starting from the Capital and Code Providers contract calculating rewards and until those MOR tokens are claimable / sendable by users.

**Can I withdraw stETH during bootstrapping?**
Yes. You can withdraw stETH after 7 days initial lock.

**Is deposited stETH locked?**
It‚Äôs not locked, you are free to withdraw anytime after 7 days.

**Why is there a 7 day lock up period?**
This measure was introduced in order to avoid people gaming the yield timing as protocol in fact rewards in advance from the moment you deposit, when yield is generated once a day.

**Can I claim MOR token during the bootstrapping period?**
MOR token will be only claimable after the bootstrapping period on the 91st Day.

**How do code providers get rewarded?**
They get emissions depending on their contributed hours vs the total amount of hours daily.

**What are the requirements to code contributors?**
There are Code Contributor Best Practices on Github.

There are also people responsible for the weights in the code documents here:

# **CAPITAL**

Please note: If you deposit additional stETH the 7 day withdraw clock is restarted for all your stETH from that address.

**What is stETH?**
stETH is a yield generating token that represents an Ethereum token that is staked in Lido.

**How do I get stETH?**
stETH can either be minted directly through the Lido or bought on exchanges.

**When does the staking for stEth start?**
Staking for stETH started on Feb 8th

**How long should I deposit stETH?**
It‚Äôs completely up to you. You can deposit for days, weeks, months or years. While your stETH deposited and contributes yield, it earns you MOR rewards.

**Should I withdraw stETH after 91 days?**
The choice is yours, you can keep stETh deposited and continue to receive MOR rewards.

**Is there a minimum or maximum amount of stETH one can deposit?**
The minimum deposit amount is 0.011 stETH and there is no maximum contribution limit. In other words No Cap on Capital Deposits.

**Have contracts been audited?**
 Yes, both the community and a dedicated auditor have reviewed the Smart Contracts, see the reports on Github.

**How will the stETH deposit contract be managed? **
There are 4 of 7 multisig managed by core open source contributors.

**Is my stETH locked?**
It is locked for the first week after deposit and you can withdraw any time after. However if you stake more stETH it will reset the lock up period.

**Is the MOR earned proportional to the amount of stETH deposited?**
Yes, MOR rewards for Capital start at 3,456 MOR per day and decrease from there over the 16 year emissions curve. This will be rebased to the Capital provider according to their contribution and the total TVL.

**Do I lose earned MOR rewards if I decide to withdraw stETH?**
No, you don‚Äôt, but you will not earn rewards any longer as you are not the Capital Provider anymore.

**How many MOR tokens I`ll get?**
It is a dynamic value that depends on the ratio of your contribution to the total amount of deposited stETH.

**What is APY for staking?**
You can‚Äôt calculate APY until MOR has a price.

**What are the risks of providing capital?**
There are always risks with smart contracts like bugs or vulnerabilities. To ensure a high level of security, the contracts have undergone multiple levels of audits, including community audit, cybersecurity company audit, as well as a public bug bounty campaign. Security reports are publicly available on GitHub. That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

**Is there more information on the Fair Price Discovery?**
Please follow the link to see what has currently being discussed https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Phased%20AMM%20Deployment%20and%20Fair%20Price%20Discovery.md

# **COMMUNITY**

**What is the Community Bucket for?**
Community is for Front End and UI Developers as well as Smart Agents


[2/6/2024 2:40 PM] mahalleinirx
# **COMPUTE AND NODE RUNNING**

**What is the Morpheus node?**
Currently Morpheus node is the local LLM, but will be evolving into the Node release by release, for people to be able to provide an inference to a MOR user.

**Is running a node mandatory?**
A regular user will be able to use Morpheus without running a node and while running the node isn‚Äôt a strict requirement for Capital and Code providers, you won‚Äôt be able to provide Compute and Community services without one.

**Are there rewards for running the Morpheus node?**
There is no reward for running a Local inference at the moment, however, a full node will be rewarded when providing Morpheus Compute and Community functions.

**How can I run the node? **
You need a Mac or PC with Linux Debian with 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core, this a minimum requirement to ensure that there will be no issue on the system side and run most LLMs, follow steps from the guides located in the readme on Github. 

**Can I run the node on Windows?**
No, only Mac and Linux Debian are supported at the moment. A guide located in the readme on GitHub.

**Why is there only Mac and Linux?**
Ollama does not provide support for Windows and that is what provides the inference.

**Can I run the node on VPS?**
You can not run one at the moment as there is no version of the node that can operate without a GUI yet.

**Is there a way to run headless nodes?**
In the future this is likely. This includes VPS inferences.

 **How do I provide compute?**
Currently there is no way to provide compute as the compute contracts are still under development, however you can still spin up and test the local inference of the node.

**Is running a node the same as providing compute?**
Running a node is NOT the same as providing compute, compute provision is still being finalized so hold tight for more information.

**Is there a platform through which I could provide compute?**
None at the moment. However, work with Akash is underway to create a template to make this possible in a decentralized fashion

**Will compute providers be able to use cloud infrastructure?**
Morpheus is agnostic to how Compute Providers provide Inference Per Second.
Akash, Bittensor, Ritual, EdgeLlama, whatever you want.

**Do compute providers earn emissions during the bootstrapping period?**
As the compute contracts are not finalized there will be no way to provide compute at this time, however, the compute emissions will still emit into the bucket to which will be used to reward providers once compute provision is possible.


**How can computer providers earn MOR during the bootstrap period when compute contract isn‚Äôt live?**
They can‚Äôt, until Compute Contracts are up and running which will hopefully be soon after bootstrapping.

**What will happen with accumulated and unused MOR Compute emissions?**
MOR emissions intended for Compute Providers will be stored in the reward distribution contract.

Cool. Welcome to the community. Looking like December testnet so it won't be long on the smart contracts for the capital contribution side anyway.

Hello, I was wondering how Morpheus works, let's say I want morpheusAI to read my emails and make a summary of them, how would that work? Can I code an API that does that and have it implemented in morpheus?

Sounds like an specialized agent that you would connect to Morpheus. People are building tons of interesting open source agents right now. Morpheus is being built to have a place to connect those agents to your data, control it with you wallet, pay for it and so forth.

found this bounty list for the TinyBox project (www.tinygrad.org). I'm not a dev, but thought it might be a pretty good idea to implement for the Morpheus community. Granted, MOR tokens are used to pay for code contribs so the economic model would be different. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WKHbT-7KOgjEawq5h5Ic1qUWzpfAzuD_J06N1JwOCGs/edit#gid=0

Do code contributions only count if they're part of the Morpheus AI repo, or can someone make an alternative client that interfaces with Morpheus via some other UI or model?


[12/14/2023 9:01 PM] cybourgeoisie
Also the smart contracts should possibly be deployed to Sepolia testnet since Goerli is nearing end of life.

@cybourgeoisie good suggestion on the tesntet upgrade.


[12/14/2023 11:15 PM] smartagents
@cybourgeoisie having multiple clients is always best, though I think getting the full reference version out there fiirst is a good idea, so that other teams of developers have a good basis on which to build.

Big thanks to @Christopher  (Morpheus) for engaging the auditors and leading that process and contributing all the resulting code to the community.

Gm, I‚Äôve just tested the UI (only on mobile atm) and it looks great and works well. I could claim MOR from my deposit without issue. The only question I have is regarding the fee for the claim TX. It seems set at 0.02 ETH. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a set amount, controlled by the UI itself, rather  than being related current gas costs?


[1/30/2024 4:46 AM] antonb
Sorry, I overlooked that fedback should be placed here, so forwarded from #üí¨Ô∏±general 
*Tested from desktop
 
1) I'd buy a beer to the dev created this UI üçª , love it

2) Token Contract button doesn't work for me.

3) I can't see my stETH balance (MOR is ok)

4) Capital sections has this description:
> People who provide the intelligence to use the frontends, capital and compute.
which might be confusing for some. Maybe it worth to rephrase.

5) "Current daily reward" reflects the whole daily emissions. I think it will be more informational to indicate emissions dedicated for each category.

6) "Started at" not clear for me is that start of rewards distribution or day of your first deposit?

7) Community tab have "Withdraw stETH" button, but Capital tab doesn't. I think it should be the other way around)

8) Coders and Compute tabs have no info and link to Github

9) Would be nice to have social links in the website footer for easier navigation

10) I'd also add information about yield earned, number of participant, daily emissions in the form of chart as more visual attractable

11) Big timer on the top counting down to the end of the bootstrapping period will definitely cause FOMO (scientifically proven) and made folks deposit more and will serve for informational purposes.

12) The are lots of question about fully diluted value, MOR price and ma–∫ket cap, we could also reflect these data realtime based on yield earned.


[1/30/2024 4:58 AM] antonb
13) For test purpose makes sense adding stETH faucet links

Ok found it in the github :^) : 0x84BE06be19F956dEe06d4870CdDa76AF2e0385f5

Can't write stETH, anyone has this problem? Tx always in pending, even with high gas


[1/30/2024 12:52 PM] antonb
Did you succeed?


[1/30/2024 10:34 PM] doudouron
After 6000 hours pending tx, yes it worked finally ü´∂


[1/30/2024 10:35 PM] doudouron
I'm trying right now to deposit


[1/30/2024 10:36 PM] antonb
Testnets require patient sometimes. Glad you deal with it

Ok, deposit, withdrawing and claming (even 0 Mor) works fine on my end

Hi one Error, my MM wallet will not connect...no matter how often I try.

Hi. Could you specify what are you trying to connect with?


[1/31/2024 3:53 AM] jshawsworld
Believe that an amount has to be specified per the claim function, and whatever is not used for gas would be returned to user (saw the returned gas in the txn when manually testing claim)

not sure but Y the fees for the CLAIM is too high ?


[1/31/2024 2:24 PM] samina5186
try using that function on the web page, and it is asking for 0.02


[1/31/2024 2:24 PM] samina5186

so, may be if there is a way, to see how much in the fees we pay when doing the transaction and then the amount that is refunded to us - that be great


[1/31/2024 4:44 PM] jshawsworld
Should see it in the txn on sepolia (e.g., from metamask)


[1/31/2024 4:51 PM] antonb
He might also mean to see an accurate  tx cost before sign

Yo! is anyone working on an iOS app for Morpheus? I could take a crack at it or collab with someone on that


[2/1/2024 4:39 AM] smartagents
Cool suggestion. The presumption is the Morpheus client would get kicked out of the App Store given all its payment rails, wallet and other things Apple frowns upon. However it would be great to have a "Progressive Web App" Friend Tech style so people can use Morpheus on mobile.


[2/1/2024 4:42 AM] daochemist
Hmmm, yeah, that's likely to happen, could a lighter version (minus the payment/action) be worth submitting? Also keen to look at a progressive web app, but there's something about that appstore validation that does add some prestige to it


[2/1/2024 4:44 AM] smartagents
Yeah. You might want to connect with the Mor.org folks (Erik and his team), they are building a permissionless ChatGPT on Morpheus. No wallet or sign in required. Might be the type of lite app that would work on the App Store. But yeah it would be awesome to have the full client on a Progressive Web App. Most people have 16 gigs of ram on there phone now and should be able to run the full LLM locally.

Dang, need to wrap my mind around that! Sounds great! Will dig into the progressive app in the coming days


[2/1/2024 4:48 AM] ra6e
I'd say best way to move forward would be to have it done in react-native probably, no need for dual code


[2/1/2024 4:48 AM] ra6e
especially if other frontends are done in react (which I'm not sure, I know I'm making a morpheus thing in react)


[2/1/2024 4:48 AM] ra6e
easy to port code etc


[2/1/2024 4:54 AM] daochemist
Yeah, I know react is very popular, need to refresh a bit on that, but sounds good. Do you have a stack in mind? I know usually folks use it with a combination of local data model that feeds the react UI


[2/1/2024 4:55 AM] daochemist
Also thinking, at any rate, like Ethereum, having multiple clients is a value add, so even if other folks also build that, there's resilience and potentially innovation that will come from having multiple clients

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[2/1/2024 5:12 AM] daochemist
Also, wondering from UI POV, I anticipate that providing a screen that simulate the consequences of a given transaction is key, so is there already talks with wallet providers like Rabbit?

and btw, the v0.0.5 debian package is broken on my machine because of a path mismatch
it's trying to start ollama using `/usr/lib/morpheus/resources/app/src/service/ollama/runners/ollama-linux`

@David Johnston am I reading it correctly that you have devoted approx. 9336 hours of work under the "Code - Proof of Contribution Table" ?


[2/14/2024 12:36 AM] smartagents
Nope. Don't think most of those are my hours. Lots of anon's gave me commits though so I had to manually merge a bunch of them.
Took a lot of time (most of a week) to get as many open source devs as possible to provide addresses before the fair launch.


[2/14/2024 12:36 AM] smartagents
Now that Morpheus is live hopefully more people will do the work themselves and add themselves directly on the Github.

But I still respect those that want to be anon, so I will help if its worth it to the code base.

Today is a exciting day for the Morpheus Community.

@Ishshogun @domsteil Lochsbagel @Maxwell_Smart_Agent and other open source devs have built the first Smart Agent on Morpheus via the experimental 0.0.6 version. 

See images attached. 
The local LLM interprets the intent of the request (using Smart Rank). 
Creates the transaction. 
Prompts Meta Mask and asks for the user's review and approval. Amazing first.

Hey @Ishshogun - I saw that the Metamask Agent is currently assuming that the JSON response for transacting is correct. I'm fairly confident that was a temporary measure üòé so I took the liberty of building on top of the code you've already done and started adding some data validation and controls as to what methods we want to support (to begin with) using Metamask. 

At some point we‚Äôll want to not rely at all on the LLM inferring a JSON response from it‚Äôs base corpus and a ZS Prompt (either switching to RAG or fine-tuning) but the data validation and controls should still be applicable there too. I've added some clear notes in the PR description (https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/pull/606) cc @Maxwell_Smart_Agent

Have you seen the PRs? I wouldn't worry right now tbh  - they're mostly translations of the whitepaper and yellowpaper into every language on earth! ü§£

There are definitely some PR's related to documentation, but the statement that they are most of all PRs is not true.

Yeah. Vast majority of hours are code related. But Documentation and global reach is worth some time.


[2/15/2024 5:00 PM] altego_
The actual code in production v. size of repo appears pretty small...and documentation while you're building is an iterative process - the last thing you need is 20 translated versions of your docs as it means a) you'll need to make changes to 20 docs in the event of an update, and b) it's a distraction to the core team who have to review the PRs.


[2/15/2024 5:02 PM] smartagents
That's fair. I know I review of lot of the PRs : )
The translation request started around the White paper which is pretty well established.
However yes for Yellow paper / Yellowstone and others still in review / being upgraded its less valuable.
I made a cut off for translations February 8th. So there aren't more hours being awared there.
However the process was very useful in developing what became the Best Practices document.

Yeah, cool. Hey, it's your biz - you can do what you like at the end of the day.

[2/15/2024 5:16 PM] smartagents
Yeah. That's a good point. I think straight up Project Management is a little too centralized for Morpheus given there is no company / foundation to direct that type of work. I think more of that will develop between individual devs working on specific projects they want to contribute to Morpheus rather than top down. 

I pulled in the Morpheus Requests for Comments and populated all the papers that have been floating around as the starting point for MRCs #s 0-8. That should be the starting point for work as many of the papers describe the coding that needs to be done Yellowstone for example with the Decentralized Compute Router. Resulting discussions / designs / technical proposals can then turn into Issues, which turn into Contributions, which get reviewed and merged in.

Project Management is what keeps projects going North when developers want to work on projects that take us East...but to be fair great Project Managers in AI/ML are unicorns.

Well said. Though the question of which direction to head in the case of Morpheus should be set by individuals and the market rather than a PM or Devs. The Techno Capital Machine paper has some interesting thoughts on this around Atomic Governance, and as other Smart Agent devs use the Morpheus TCM to provide resources to their projects it will be interesting to see the market for projects and direction emerge from MOR holders directing support toward the projects they want to see built : )

[2/15/2024 5:44 PM] altego_
Will have another read. In practise, our direction is led by customers but no-one in Web3 actually talks to Web2 peeps anymore... we actually need (to use a Steve Blank quote) "to get out the building and talk to our customers". This will help set the general direction but we also need to know how to take that direction, turn them into quarterly priorities, and then set themes > epics > sprints > tickets...never in my life have I met a developer who didn't like a good kanban (to turn up to on Monday and switch off to on a Friday) ü§ì


[2/15/2024 5:46 PM] altego_
there's too much 'let's build it and hope they come' going on in Web3 and it's even worse in AI right now


[2/15/2024 5:47 PM] antonb
May I know how would you formulate your idea in a brief way as I'm a bit lost in the amount of text? Sorry.


[2/15/2024 5:55 PM] altego_
Lead Data Scientist, API Designer, Solutions Architect, MLOps etc. hash out priorities for next 6 months...let's call them foundational priorities (i.e. things that need to be built regardless of which direction we're heading)...a good PM then works with them to convert these priorities into synergistic themes i.e. 2-3 epics that can be achieved in ~4-6 weeks. These epics are then converted into 'tickets' which are then posted into a community board...etc.


[2/15/2024 5:59 PM] altego_
We need to be able to 'weaponise' our community by mobilising them at scale to execute and 'charge in the same direction'...if we can do that, then we'll actually be able to turn our decentralised community into an army of one

Doesn't sound like an open source  approach, but more like strict administration.


[2/15/2024 6:04 PM] smartagents
Yeah I think a diversity of ideas and solutions is the strength of open source. Let a lot of experiments run and see what the market supports : )


[2/15/2024 6:05 PM] smartagents
Hard to know given how early it is what to even focus on. Instead let people create a bunch of Smart Agents and the market will sort out which ones are popluar / useful.


[2/15/2024 6:05 PM] smartagents
Its like the old modular vs integrated debate. Nice to integrate everything once you even know what to integrate. Early on modular tends to win.

I've been in crypto for 7 years and worked with 37 startups/projects as an advisor or consultant and not a single time was planning carried out for more than one month.
I mean, you can plan six months or even years ahead, but in 90% it will be a waste of time, as web3 is about agility and adaptation on the go.
Just my opinion based on observations.

Don't get me wrong, but this is not a constructive discussion when you consider only your opinion is correct and anyone else is wrong.
I'd better listen to the counter arguments as it's interesting for me, but instead you said: "Gold", "Good luck"


[2/15/2024 6:25 PM] smartagents
All good. Different approaches. Open source / Crypto way is messy, noisy, wonders in different directions but that's a really good way to explore an unmapped space. Where things are better understood / all figured out one can optimize more. However Decentralized AI is early to say the least.

the governance structure could get to a place where teams organize centrally within themselves to improve their contributions to the open source ecosystem and maximize their rewards.


[2/16/2024 4:37 AM] smartagents
Yeah. Nothing wrong with people specializing and collaborating to write great code that's valuable to the community. Morpheus is agnostic to how people organize themselves, individual, team, DAO, Foundation, as long as all the MOR tokens are always rewarded in fair / neutral competition. I'm sure interfaces and Dash boards for Coders and all that will evolve to make it easier and accessible to a lot of devs.

Where I think its important to draw the line is what I'd term "centralization", as when people use their power to get an unfair advantage. Anyone who proposes a DAO to "run" Morpheus or centralize some treasury they control would be engaged in an attack on the entire concept of Atomic Governance and letting the individual / free market decide.

When making code changes, I was always skeptical whether it would break the normal working of the project. 

Since our project is being actively developed, it'd be wise to have a set of tests that ensure that the critical functionality is intact. This will give developers enough confidence (especially new folks in the community) that their changes aren't breaking the project.

Here's a basic setup that checks the integration of the project with Ollama Requesting Review https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/pull/632

One of the wallet addresses ( 0xfe17147301888fBEEc36be3a8e6E4f883496ed33) got approved for a total of 1,860 hours. This contributor called "Anon 33" has had the highest number of hours approved over any other contributor. 

And in the description of their work, all it says is "Anon 33 Contribution to papers, reviews, and code."

Why was this approved with such a vague description? 

And can we get more transparency on what the actual work done here to warrant such an approval?

Rewards accrue every block for each category of the contributors.

one more question here - https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Coding%20Guide/Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md. 

It  says "The code base is ever evolving. Hours credited only last as long as the Code base / Github is utalizing the Code you provided". Earlier @antonb | will not DM you you had mentioned the snapshot for distributions was done monthly. 

However, does that mean: 

a) You only look at new contributions made in a given month / total contributions that month OR

b) You look at new contributions made in a given month / total contributions since inception


[2/21/2024 7:38 PM] antonb
Good question. I personally think that longer periods are mentioned here, such as years. It's no secret that documentation and code can become outdated and and its periodic review, for example once a year, can be a factor stimulating constant participation in development and updating, as well as provide an opportunity for a new developer to enter the Morpheus through the revision of a contribution that has not been used for a long time. IMO.

hmm, so it is A or B or something else?

I'm not in the business of Doxxing people. 
But as the Github maintainer of that repository I can validate that anon more than earned those hours in terms of value to the Morpheus code, architecture work, papers, and value to the community.
Too much description of the contribution would likely Doxx their identity.

# Morpheus Github Reorganization

Github has been reorganized today into 9 more focused repositories for Docs, MRCs, TCM, Node, Morpheus, Dashboard, Smart Contracts, Smart Agents & Morpheus Linux. 

All the papers, contributions, and technical documents have been moved to the "Docs" repository, so please direct Code Contributions to that repo going forward. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md

If you find any broken website links to Github as a result DM me and I'll direct the feedback to the open source dev it effects.
- Mor.org updated 
- MorpheusAI.org updated 
- Dashboard update pending.

Thanks to @antonb | will not DM you @The Oracle and @Maxwell_Smart_Agent

No need for anyone to be doxed here, writing a clear description of the work done is not going to dox anyone. It's being transparent and honouring the code contribution guidelines which clearly state that a description of the work should be provided. Transparency and equal standards for all are super important here, otherwise trust will break down in the community. 

And when 72% of MOR emissions can essentially be allocated at will by the repo owner (which I understand is you), transparency is paramount. 

Not trying to create FUD here, really think Morpheus can be an amazing project and has the start of a great community.  But approving such large MOR allocations without proper disclosure of work completed is concerning. And really gives the impression of a core team behind the scenes that is scratching each other's backs and applying one standard for themselves, and then another for everyone else.


[2/22/2024 10:44 PM] smartagents
That's fair feedback. I'll look at the best way to expand the description in a responsible way.

Though I have to correct the statements that "72%" of MOR emissions will not be a matter of a Github maintainer judgement.

24% will go to Compute Providers which will be automated by the Decentralized Router, check out the Yellowstone paper. This will be entirely deterministic. Same for the 24% Community Frontend Builder that will be deterministic as well as proven by on chain activity. 

The Coding rewards will also as Deterministic as possible. @Maxwell_Smart_Agent has built a Dashboard which I believe will be posted shortly to make it easy for lots of devs to get involved. I think Morpheus is extremely transparent and has been built in public since day one. Though again I believe in personal privacy, I agree all protocol functions must be open source and public.


[2/22/2024 10:47 PM] smartagents
If the choice is between a perfect reward mechanism and not rewarding a broad set of developers. I land firmly on the side of contining to reward as broad a set of developers as possible as this is key to a growth of a open source project. Normally only Capital and Compute get honored. In the Morpheus context Coders get rewarded as well. Its worth cotinuing to iterate and improve this process.


[2/22/2024 11:11 PM] 0x_trinity
The community frontend/distribution methodology and whether that is deterministic or subjective is still under discussion afaik (waterloo paper still in review stage)? See here: https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1167520940297551913/1209826576288714773

Not sure who is going to be making the final call here in absence of token holder voting or some functional governance mechanism, but would be good to have some clarity on this. And if the multisig will end up collecting the funds attributed to this in the interim/pending a final decision being made.

Taking lots of feedback recently into account big announcements for Code Contributors.

# Coders Dashboard at Mor.Software
Website: https://mor.software/

Big thanks to @Maxwell_Smart_Agent for building a Coders Dashboard for the developer community to use.

This will make it a lot easier for Developers who want to get involved in providing Code Contributions to Morpheus.
Just click the "Register as a Developer" button, then input your Github handle and Ethereum address and other info and the Dashboard will create you a "MOR DEV ID". These DEV IDs will be included in pull requests related to Code Contributions starting in the March snapshot of Code Contributors. 

The Dashboard will also start connecting in Issues and existing known Coding needs so it makes it easier for devs to find what needs to be worked on next. Later it the Dashboard will provide a way for Devs to check their weights recorded in the monthly Coding snapshots and the resulting MOR they have earned and can be claimed at their address. 

## Code Contributor Guide To Earning Weights & Their Implied Value
In a related effort to make it easier for developers to understand how to bid on providing code and the value of the coding "weights" they earn and how that translates into MOR tokens I've written this guide and added it to Github.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/English%20Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md

One change worth noting is that the term "hours" proved very confusing as it was meant as proxy for weights / value contributed to the Coding Contributions not literal hours. So hours as a term has been replaced by "weights". Hopefully the guide will make it clear on how to think about the potential value of these weights and how that is determined by the free market based on the amount of stETH contributed and after May 8th the free market price of MOR / wETH.

Just signed up to the dashboard and finished reading all the documentation, whitepapers and yellowpapers. I must confess that I'm still confused in regards to what is being built now and the roadmap of the project.

There's a lot of quality content reading the whole MRC repo, but I'd suggest adding a more clear roadmap and description for the different components. I was only really able to check progress on the smart contract and staking features going from that repo.

The actual implementations or attempts of for SmartContractRanking, Smart Agents and all of their components are either outdated or haven't been worked on at all. I looked through the repos and there are even mentions to OpenAI API keys in some of the readme files.

Just checked the new coders dashboard page and really liked the idea, but I feel like a list of issues incoming devs should work on is a must have to actually engage a good quantity of talented engineers in protocol building.

Would love if someone could better walk me through which repos are priority to work on  and which issues are priority. After I get a grasp of it I could organize the information and create a framework for new devs to start working on the protocol.

All good feedback. Agreed there is a lot to do still to stream line the funnel of developer work from MRCs, to Code proposals, to issues, or code contributions. Lot of devs will be at ETH Denver. I hear some of the them will be presenting more details on the work they are proposing for Morpheus. More to come on the 28th during the Decentralized AI Day.

Just finished proofreading the Code Contributor Weights Guide - overall I think it does a great job of laying out a framework, but I had a couple of comments/questions which would help to clarify several points:

(1) The estimations of weight to USD value are all based on a 1 year span. The implication here is that code will be included in weights and provided monthly allocations so long as it stays relevant. Said differently, code contributed in February 2024 will earn not only for February 2024, but could earn for the whole year, or the whole 16 years of emissions if it is still deemed relevant. So my first question is confirming that code will be allocated weights for as long as it is relevant, not just in the month of submission?

(2) Assuming that contributions are cumulative and not just in the submission month, then I would say that the USD valuations per weight are overstated. If there are 20,000 weights already in the system in the first month, then over the course of a year it seems very likely that this amount climbs significantly. Let's assume there are 20,000 weights per month, someone with 200 weights now would be earning 1% of Code emissions in February, but would only be earning 0.08% of Code emissions a year from now when the cumulative weights are up to 240,000 total (and assuming their code is still relevant). This math would take the example in the paper down from 200 weights earning 12,410 MOR in a year, all the way down to 3,160 MOR in a year due to monthly dilution of weights.

Current 0.0.5 node release is a local LLM, while 0.0.6. will have web3 wallet connection and 0.0.7 will be able to do some magic with smart contracts. Eventually it will evolve to the node you can use as your local Smart Agent or Provide Compute/Connect your apps with Morpheus.

sure, I'm mostly wondering what the purposes of the `L1Sender`, `L2MessageReceiver`, and `L2TokenReceiver` contracts are

it seems like the `L2TokenReceiver` receives stETH from `L1Sender`, which is used for the TCM / to bootstrap liquidity -- is that correct?

no idea what the `L2MessageReceiver` is used for or why these contracts need LayerZero


[3/3/2024 5:45 AM] antonb
These are contacts needed to claim MOR on Arbitrum, while stETH deposits are on ETH mainnet.

Hello Morpheus :photo_20240206_222448: !

I am Hattori Hanzo, steel code master. As my first contribution to this amazing project, I have made an small audit of the smart contracts (https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/SmartContracts/pull/24).

Luckily I have not been able to find any big issue despite some minor enhancements. Since I am new in Morpheus, I would love to hear your feedback and get some guidance regarding the code contribution rewards.

Expecting a long journey with you,

Gotcha, once this is merged I will add the efforts to the Proof of Contribution.

Not really into audits, but I can double check and review some PRs if needed. I decided to start from here since this is a core part and offered me a good overview of the capital pilar. I have read about the router doc design and I think I can provide good design insights as well as coding tasks.

Mainly blockchain protocol and solidity smart contract dev. Also have usual stack with typescript for frontend / backend.

My first insight in the router and the node would be that filecoin's proof of replication https://filecoin.io/proof-of-replication.pdf can be a better algorithm for ensuring node's LLM availability. I will try to elaborate a more detailed doc with the details on where I think it fits.

## Morpheus Reference Implementations
One of the common questions lately has been how the Coding rewards work, what areas need to be developed next and who is best to talk with about each aspect of Morpheus. So I've created this diagram of the 10 "Morpheus Reference Implementations" (MRIs) are being built and by whom.

## List of Existing Morpheus Reference Implementations
1. Smart Contracts on Ethereum / Arbitrum
2. Smart Agents Tools & Examples
3. Morpheus Local Install Desktop / Mobile
4. TCM / MOR20 Token Standard for Fair Launches
5. Protection Fund
## List of New Morpheus Reference Implementations
6. Capital Proofs Extended beyond Lido stETH
7. Compute Proofs Morpheus / Lumerin
8. Code Proofs & Dashboards
9. Frontend Proofs & Examples
10. Interoperability
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Reference%20Implementations.md

## Estimating Morpheus Coder Weight Values
The second aspect is for Coders once they know where to contribute, to understand the value of the Coding weights they earn. The developer of Morstats.info has extended his interface to include projection of Coder weight values.
https://morstats.info/code-weights/

## Weight Emissions Schedule & Proposed Supply Cap of 50,000 
The weights earned by Coders are only valuable if they are scarce. So to offer clarity on the estimate for the number of Coder weights that will exist lets presume there is a cap of 50 thousand weights the end of the Coder reward period (16 years).
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/English%20Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#weights-emissions-schedule--supply-cap

[3/5/2024 6:13 PM] tstereth
I feel like the issue of how to estimate weights is still somewhat unanswered. Looking through the repos it seems at some point weights = hours. Can understand why this had to be changed.

But I also saw a comparison that stated one weight should approximate $400 of contributions to the protocol (i.e. the value of MOR emitted over one year at some arbitrary price). I feel like this doesn't quite make sense either since weights can be overridden when code is updated (or outdated), which is likely to happen often given the nascency of the project


[3/5/2024 6:16 PM] tstereth
Also think it could be helpful to establish a mid-term plan for how weights will be moderated/approved. Right now the system seems to work but I imagine following TGE, there will be a large number of contributions and a greater monetary interest, which might need a more systematic/objective approach


[3/5/2024 6:17 PM] tstereth
Excited to share a PR this week which adds comprehensive smart contract documentation!


[3/5/2024 6:29 PM] happyagain
I fully support your point of view. The reward system is opaque, subjective, and raises numerous questions. Moreover, the process of making contributions is completely unclear, whether they will be accepted, what tasks in the pipeline and repos are often not updated. On one hand, they declare openness to new developers, and on the other, they create maximum obstacles for this.


[3/5/2024 6:43 PM] antonb
@tstereth @happyagain Thank for your valuable feedback, guys. I am very sorry that you have this impression, because it does not correspond to what actually is. Yes, I admit that not everything is perfect, but we are at the very beginning of the amazing journey of Morpheus that is built in different from the wide market way and if you see that some part can be improved, then your input is welcome.

@tstereth @happyagain 
There are a lot of resources on how to add Code and how weights work. Here I'll put them all in one list.

There is a estimator, a detailed guide to weights, a guide for making contributions, a list of best practices and a transparent list of all Code Contributors. Plus a list of all major Reference Implementations and whom is working on them. Not sure how it could be more transparent then that. 

@Maxwell_Smart_Agent has launched Mor.Software as a Coder Dashboard and it will literally connect any dev who wants to add value to existing Code issues and help them track their contributions. Happy Coding.

If you are looking for committees, and RFPs you are looking at the wrong project. The nature of Morpheus is Atomic Governance. That means experts build what they want and Github maintainers act as judges to merge if its in the platform or users decide to use the Smart Agent in an open marketplace. Coders here compete. No guarantees anyone will use the Code until its released.

Hi there. pinging again for the code for the dashboard to be open sourced. Myself and other community members have already pinged a few times regarding this over the past few weeks. Not really fair to ask the community to contribute code to the project if the code itself is not open source. We would appreciate it if you can get this pushed to the public repo asap üôè

Hey Trinity. Rest assured I remember about your ask, the code must be pushed this week when some upgrades with the dashboard implemented.

hello, i have a question related to the second phase of code proof and rewards: the post launch phase when there is specialized agents/tools being used. couldn't find any info related to this in the latest github references that all seem to focus on the launch phase

the whitepaper says on this second phase:
"Once there are specialized agents, tools or chains (sequence of prompts/calls to an LLM) interoperable with Morpheus, then half (50%) of the rewards will go to their developers. The reward will be calculated in proportion to the usage of those agents."

question:
- how would the usage of agents be measured? depending on the fee market for code/intelligence there are many ways in which usage metrics can be exploited by individuals/groups to extract value from the system (a type of MEV). are there resources on this or anyone working/thinking about it that i can talk to?


[3/6/2024 12:47 PM] antonb
There are two things two consider:
1. The specialized agents, tools or chains mentioned above are related to Code providers rewards, i.e. if they become part of the Morpheus protocol, more specifically, they improve or extend capabilities of built-in Smart Agent. So the contributor is rewarded according to the value he brought to Morpheus.
2.  Your question seems is more about third party apps/tools that fall under Communty app builders category, details of which are still under development. I'd love to ask you to join the discussion and share your ideas here:

As requested, I'm sharing a proposal (MRC) by Mor Labs to gather community feedback on adding stMATIC to the Capital Contracts. 

If implemented, this would allow stMATIC to participate in the Morpheus ecosystem and show their support to the project whilst earning MOR. 

Here is a link to the MRC: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC?tab=readme-ov-file#mrc-12-capital-contracts-expansion-to-stmatic

And here is a link to the actual proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZ_vJ3exkrn8DscHI6C59unp5Lui895rtN4nc-e2wso/edit

Please let us know what you think on this by commenting directly on the google doc so that we can keep track of the comments and revise the proposal if necessary in-line with community feedback. üôè

Mor Labs is a new guild that has formed from within the Morpheus community to work on various projects within the Morpheus ecosystem. You can view some of these proposals here https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/ . Some of them are quite large in scope so we think it's better suited to a team execution rather than a single contributor.

[3/9/2024 1:58 AM] tigerbuidl.
this is true but on MORstats it says that there are 38,328.00 Code weights when here it says that there should only be a Max of 25,000 at this time here https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1167520984849469530/1215669296089407528


[3/9/2024 2:24 AM] chasingdreams4026
That's correct - I'm happy to update the calculation as needed. The key item is confirming the timing of the weights. For example, the Annual  Coding Weights for Year 1 is listed at 25,000 per the guide - If that time period started on Sept 2, 2023 then then that would extend to September 2024 (which is only 6 months of emissions from the fair launch on February 8, 2024) so an additional 6 months of the 'Year 2' weights would actually be in Year 1.  In this case, the total weights for year 1 would be 31,250 (25,000 for the first six months plus 6,250 for the second six months represented by the first half of 'year 2'). Alternatively, if the 25,000 for Year 1 represents through Feb 8, 2025, then I agree the total should be 25,000. Happy to adjust to whatever the correct methodology is

Code Contributions began being recorded the day the anons dropped the white paper. So September 2nd 2023. So September 2nd 2024 would be the conclusion of the first 12 months (year 1). We are already 7 months into the first 12 months.


[3/9/2024 4:32 AM] smartagents
Monthly snapshot 1 captured all weights up to February 8th 2024. All used the $50 USD rule of thumb for weights.


[3/9/2024 4:32 AM] smartagents
Snapshot 2 from February 8th 2024 to March 8th 2024. Using $400 USD as the new implied value of a weight.

This will continue to be used monthly for March 8th to April 8th and April 8th to May 8th, based on the average stETH deposited implied value each month. Until May 8th to June 8th 2024 when the market price of MOR can take over to anchor the implied value of a weight.

Got it - Here's my thoughts on how to present that nuance in the Weights Calculator page: 

Month 1 in Emissions (Feb 2024) is actually Month 6 in Contributions for Weights. So the 25,000 weights is what will be earned by the end of the Contributions Year 1 (Sept 2024) which is Emissions Month 7. By the end of the Emissions Year 1 (Jan 2025), there will be 30,208 weights - this comes from 25,000 the first Contributions Year plus 5 months of weights from Contributions Year 2 when it is 1,042 weights monthly (12,500 annualized).

Since most people using the calculator are concerned with the MOR they could earn, I've got Month 1 as Feb 2024. And the Year 1 value of a weight is calculating based on emissions earned from Feb 2024 - Jan 2025.

Hey everyone. Just a heads up. I worked with the other Github maintainers to update the Smart Contract for "Snapshot 2" for all Code Contributions from February 8th to March 8th. 

For the next snapshot 3, please help me out by having all your addresses submitted and pull requests complete at least 4 days before the April 8th cut off. It helps a lot. I stayed up to 4 am to try and include everyone, but I'd like to avoid that next month : )

I've also updated the Weights Guide links and added details about the implied value for each snapshot based on the guides calculation.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md
- September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight "Snapshot 1" = $50 USD per Weight
- February 8th to March 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 2" = $400 USD Per Weight
- March 8th to April 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 3" = $641 USD per Weight
Keep this new value in mind as you submit your pull request. Remember the best price for the best code wins the competition and gets merged toward the end of every period.

To avoid confusion with new contributions vs previous contributions I've also created a clean Snapshot 3 file on Github for everyone to use for the March 8th to April 8th period. Please submit pull requests against this file.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_ContributionSnapshot3.md

Lastly, there were a few addresses submitted that were not valid Ethereum addresses. Copy and paste is not perfect. Please check your address is valid before submitting it to a pull request. Thanks.

In reference to this, I read from @antonb | will not DM you  commenting that they were studying ways to avoid MEV attacks on launch day. Given that nothing is commented on this in the 009 MRC, where could I follow up on the status of the ideas discussed?


[3/11/2024 7:24 PM] mechaverse
In reference to this other thing, a question arises for me. There are some contributions that request a disproportionate number of weights for tasks without clear justification (some do not even point to a PR). Then there may be other contributions that ask for a sensibly higher than reasonable weights for a task well performed.

How is the distribution managed in these cases taking into account that it is a 0-sum situation between the contributor and the rest of the community? How can the community "audit" the correct distribution of weights? I do not question your criteria, I have been following the project in the shadows for some time and I clearly see that there are very capable people. I just think these questions make some sense.

During the research it was discovered that using Arbitrum as the home chain for the liquidity, eliminates front run MEV risks due to FCFS approach for ordering txs and absence of a mempool.

Another risk that was taken into account was the high listing price, if the liquidity is created by pairing 100% MOR from the Protection Funds and 100% of generated yield. That would lead to the use of bots for sales on top, which would benefit a very limited number of people.
In turn, this risk was resolved through the liquidity creation method described in the proposal.

> How can the community "audit" the correct distribution of weights?
It's everything in the contract, every month new weights/addresses are added. It's acknowledged that not everyone have enough technical skills to audit these directly from blockchain, so in response to that and to improve and make the process more transparent, this information will be available in human-friendly form at https://mor.software/

Hi! üëã   I've been lurking for a while. Happy to finally introduce myself and excited to realize the potential here.

I noticed that there was some confusion in the Discord from potential contributors wondering what to work on, especially regarding Smart Agent development. So I spent the past week with some teammates reviewing everything, thinking it through and writing up a product-led technical strategy for Smart Agent development.  This is an extension to MRC-0, starting from the user needs we're trying to address, identifying common requirements and translating these into a technical strategy that pulls together the various pieces and proposes a Smart Agent SDK.

As brief background I've been a CTO / product guy for both crypto projects and AI ventures (specifically conversational AI) in the past. 

I'll leave the draft here as a google doc and invite all comments and contributions.  I intend to submit it as a MRC if there is positive feedback. I'm sure there is lots of work going on that I'm not aware of so if someone could help me to coordinate with the relevant people that would be great, I look forward to collaborating.

Quick update on Morstats.info for Code Contributors. I've added two new pages: (1) Weights Snapshot - this shows the calculation and snapshots for the two completed periods plus the period ending April 8, 2024. I also have a calculator that allows users to input their estimates for average stETH and ETH price to see what they think the next snapshot value will be and (2) a page that allows users to query their address to see the MOR earnings for their code. Both of these pages are found under the Code Weights submenu. As always, please feel free to send feedback or suggestions.

Hey all, I noticed an inconsistency in the Morpheus docs and other writings with regards to what the trading pair for MOR will be on Arbitrum - MOR/WETH or MOR/wstETH

I thought it would be good to address this now so there are no surprises later down the line, so I raised an issue with an explanation and possible resolutions here: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/issues/95

Keen to get others' feedback/review.

[3/13/2024 1:09 AM] antonb
Hi Thomas. Good catch. The liquidity on Arbitrum will be in the MOR/wETH pair, which is the best explanation for the user.
But the actual process will have several steps:
1. Yield in the form of stETH is bridged to Arbitrum.
2. Arbitrum chain gets equivalent of stETH, which is wstETH.
3. wstETH is exchanged to wETH


[3/13/2024 1:37 AM] tstereth
Hi Anton. Agreed that MOR/WETH makes the most sense.

Two concerns regarding step 3:

1. The contract responsible for managing PoL on Arbitrum `L2TokenReceiver` doesn't seem to have dedicated functions for swapping wstETH into WETH. There *is* a `swap` function which in theory could be used if the contract's swap parameters are changed back and forth between every transaction (it seems the contract was developed primarily to support swapping MOR, not wstETH). However, it would be limited to Uniswap V3.

2. Liquidity for wstETH/WETH is limited on Arbitrum. At present there is $9.3m of liquidity on Uniswap consisting of $8.5m WETH and $800k wstETH which should be more than enough. However, this makes Morpheus somewhat reliant on third-party liquidity providers.

Initially I thought it made more sense to swap stETH for ETH/WETH on Ethereum mainnet. But maybe there's enough liquidity on Arbitrum. In any case, it could be worth modifying the `L2TokenReceiver` contract to better support wstETH to WETH swaps, for instance by adding Balancer support.


[3/13/2024 1:55 AM] antonb
These are valid points. 
I believe that liquidity management and swap contracts for MOR will include support of several source for wstETH/WETH conversion, but to check with devs one more time. üôè

[3/13/2024 4:02 AM] smartagents
All fair points. 
Agreed. There needs to be more work on the details of the past contributions.
There are a few historical challenges here. 
1. Before the project fair launch many devs didn't even provide an Ethereum address because they didn't know when the project would launch or if the tokens would have any value. So now that Morpheus has seen so much success, past Code Contributors have had more motivation to provide info so they can be included in the Coding rewards. 
2. Many devs expressed an interest in staying anon. This presents more challenges as many of their contributions would by nature reveal this Github or other identities.
3. The value of Code Contributions weights was around $50 USD implied value before February 8th, which now based on real world yield contributions is around $400 for Feb. 8th to March 8th and now in the March 8th to April 8th snapshot going to be $641 USD or more. So its a bit of apples and oranges to compare contributions between different snapshots, as the risk premium for devs now is far lower than developers who contributed before the project's fair launch.
I'll see what I can do to clean up the descriptions without breaking privacy expectations.

Though I don't think its a zero sum game. All code contributions should be "accretive". Meaning they get merged and their weights included because they add more value than they dilute value. It creates a natural check. The Github maintainer wants to improve Morpheus softare, but will only do so it the weight request is reasonable so as to not overly dilute their own contributions.

Good question. When I review a Pull Request and the Weight Request is too high I leave a comment and point them to the Weights Guide and the Best Practices guide so they can better understand the value they are asking for via the implied value of the weights. If they correct the request to a reasonable weight I merge the Pull Request. If not I just close the Pull Request and wait for someone else to offer the Code at a better rate.

After reading a several times the information regarding the weights, I have some gaps. Excuse my possible confusions.

1- Does the smart contract function getCurrentUserRewards by selecting Pool 1 (Code contributors), show the user's balance in MOR?

2- In snapshot 2, a total of 141 unique contributors requested 108250.84 weights. However, I understand that only 2000 are awarded per month. Is it correct to think that, after adjusting extreme requests, what is done is to calculate a % of contribution for that snapshot and deliver the weights corresponding to that % of participation?

3- The smart contract poolsData function indicates that 23462 units of something that I understand must be weights have been deposited. It fits me from what I have read elsewhere. If we are currently in month 7 of the first year approximately and in the first year only 25000 weights should be distributed, does that mean that there are only 1548 weights left to be distributed in 5 months?


[3/13/2024 6:54 PM] antonb
Good questions üëç 

1) It shows how many MOR the address has earned.

2) I wonder how you calculated this figure, as I think that 108250.84 weights is not correct.

3)  Yes, poolsData function indicates stETH deposited amount for Capital Providers and weights issued for Code Providers, which is 23462 weights.


[3/13/2024 6:56 PM] tstereth
Yeah based on my calculations total weights issued are currently around 20,000

Regarding question 2, I just did a  =SUM(C2:C210) of all the rows of https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md

108250 weights requested exceed the 23462 granted.

As to question #3. @Mechaverse 
Yes the weights total is quickly approaching the 25,000 limit proposed for year 1 in the weights cap schedule. Though I'd make a few points here: 

1. The implied value of the weights has been dramatically increasing with each snapshot from $50, to $400 to $641 per weight in snapshot 3 (may be adjusted based on the average for the month), so the weights are able to reward far more work now than before the fair launch. **This is highly conservative as its only reflecting the value of the weights as held and MOR collected over 12 months.**

2. The remaining 1,548 weights have an implied value of $992,268 USD. Spread over the remaining 5 months (presuming no more increases in the weight value in the next 5 snapshots), that equals $198,453 USD of weight rewards available each month.

3. Many of the biggest areas of rewards such as the work on the Decentralized Router got included in Snapshot 2. So those areas of the Morpheus Reference Implementations are in effect already budgeted for.

4. Weight issues already included in past snapshots are not fixed / static forever. If developers fail to maintain code / features they contributed or the code / feature is removed depreciated from the Morpheus code base those weights will be returned to a reserve or partly assigned to the new maintainer of that code. So some weights will return to the available pool over time.

The Smart Contract devs have updated feature with Wallet Connect. You can test it here https://morpheus-dev.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/#/mainnet/capital. If it all tests passed, then they will deliver this changes to production."

[3/14/2024 3:55 PM] marmalade_dev
Yes, I understand that. But "Github maintainers of the 10 Morpheus Reference Implementations should seek to get contributions for something less than this maximum number." from https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md.

Right now, for example, the main developer has 7k+ weight points for this year. And in Year 1 the limit is 25,000. Of which 18,418+ (from parsed table) have already been distributed to past contributors.

If Github maintainers earn points close to the max, will there still be points for regular developers and contributors?


[3/14/2024 4:51 PM] marmalade_dev
I'm also curious about a few things:

1. Is there ~1500 points left for this year?
2. Some of the past contributors have gotten 400-1600 points each, which even with the $50/point price, is pretty expensive
3. How does saving code weights of a contributor and distribution to the reserve work if someone fails to save these points? Some of the contributions in the snapshot are not code at all (articles/videos). Also what about old contributors whose code has been used for a while and then that code is obsolete, so such people won't be rewarded?


[3/14/2024 4:52 PM] antonb
These are reasonable points, I'll try to explain.
There are several moment that you need to keep in mind:
- protocol has started development in sept-oct 2023
- implied value of a weight for snapshot 1 is twelve times less than now
- some of the addresses in the table are actually teams of devs
- the less weights we have, the more their value

At the moment about ~23500 weights have been distributed.

[3/14/2024 4:57 PM] marmalade_dev
Thanks, yes, I know about that. About, "the less weights we have, the more their value," you mean, total? Not per contributor?


[3/14/2024 4:57 PM] marmalade_dev
It's just that when those 1500 points run out, it's unclear how the points will be distributed afterward. Either the awards will end and we have to wait for the next year. Or points will be canceled from the previous contributors, which is unclear how it works.


[3/14/2024 4:58 PM] antonb
1) 1538 is accurate number
2) If you think that they are top developers in their fields who worked several months for free with risk that Morpheus will never release, I find these figures modest.
3) I think there will be reviews, let's say once in six month, and contributions that are outdated, not maintained properly or not in use/demand, will be removed to free up more weights for new developers.

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[3/14/2024 5:09 PM] antonb
I think that with Morpheus development it will become more visible to broader community which brings more contributors to compete fro limited amount of weights.


[3/14/2024 5:09 PM] marmalade_dev
Thanks.

2) Reasonable

But tbh if we're talking, about snapshot 2 with a $400/wp valuation, that seems a bit much when 400+ points for 1 pull request with a few commits. I'm reasoning purely from a project perspective, because it potentially reduces the motivation of other open-source not-core contributors.

But I realize that this is probably just how core team tokens are distributed instead of allocated. I would do it myself if I were a team. It's just that this approach has the disadvantage I described above given that the points are severely limited.


[3/14/2024 5:10 PM] antonb
My understanding, is that repository owners will maintain proportions so we don't run out of weights one time.


[3/14/2024 5:12 PM] marmalade_dev
Makes sense, I didn't know about that.


[3/14/2024 5:15 PM] antonb
I reckon that there were reasons to merge that pull request and accept proposed weights as weights are NOT based on the Labor Theory of Value. It doesn't matter how many hours are worked but rather the value produced by the work.

Morpheus has no formal team or founders and launched in fair way without pre-mine or other tokens allocations. so it's not correct to say "core team tokens".


[3/14/2024 5:17 PM] marmalade_dev
Although in my opinion it's pretty hard to properly check contributions. Given the competition, for example, some of the easy but necessary contributions may simply not be accepted. Or fractional weight points (0.1+) should be accepted as well.


[3/14/2024 5:18 PM] antonb
If you think that this approach can be improved and you have have proper skills and experience, the suggestions and ideas are welcome. That's nothing that set in stone and Morpheus is constantly evolving  üôÇ

The persentage of each pool is determined in tokenomics. All emissions started at the same time, on the 8th of February, but only  Code and Capital providers rewards will be claimable after the bootstrapping period, when Compute and Community are stored in the contract until launch of the corresponding phases.


[3/15/2024 2:08 PM] harshlee
Thanks, I've looked through the docs and code as well, I'm speaking specifically to the code, I can't find it. A follow up question would to know if each pool created has an wallet address it receives funds in, from which the funds are then dispered to the rewardees

Ah, I'm not so technical to explain how the contract code works from inside. 

> A follow up question would to know if each pool created has an wallet address it receives funds in
I as see it, there is no specific address, as each user claim its rewards and get them to the address he indicated. Technically, he signs L0 message on Ethereum that orders contract to mint tokens on Arbitrum.


[3/15/2024 2:46 PM] harshlee

There is no one person, you can leave your queries in discord and someone from contributors would pick them up.


[3/15/2024 3:25 PM] tstereth
The weighting of each pool is determined by the reward parameters set here: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Smart%20Contracts/Distribution.md#pool


[3/15/2024 3:26 PM] tstereth
and as @antonb | will not DM you mentioned, tokens are not held by the pools themselves or `Distribution`, they're minted ad hoc by `L2TokenReceiver`


[3/15/2024 3:30 PM] tstereth
To expand on this, if you query the contract's `pools` view, you'll see both pool 0 and 1 have an 86400 second interval (1 day) with a reward of 3456 tokens decreasing by 0.59 each day

I thought the MOR emissions for Code Providers were being sent to a multisig? And then from the multisig, they would be allocated to addresses with approved code contributions?


[3/15/2024 7:03 PM] antonb
Emissions for Code providers operate in the same as Capital providers and will be opened to claim on May 8th.


[3/15/2024 8:06 PM] 0x_trinity
so you're saying they are not first being sent to the multisig for Code Provider distributions?


[3/15/2024 8:09 PM] antonb
I can't exclude this hypothetically, but I've never heard or read about this.
AFAIK, all the rewards are issued through the distribution contract.


[3/15/2024 8:09 PM] 0x_trinity
Distribution contract > Code Providers Pool > Multisig > Code contributors. is my understanding. Might be wrong but that's how I thought it worked.


[3/15/2024 8:10 PM] antonb
What is the ground for this way of thinking about Code rewards distribution?


[3/15/2024 8:15 PM] antonb
The distribution contract accrues rewards for the Code contributors based on the data added each month after the snapshot of the Contribution table and will be simply claimed after the bootstrapping period and AMM launch.


[3/15/2024 8:17 PM] antonb
I'm asking as maybe you saw such formulation somewhere and it needs to be edited?


[3/15/2024 8:20 PM] 0x_trinity
Upon checking the distribution.sol again, I do indeed not see the mention of a multisig. But then for the 4% emitted to "Protection Resources" where is that going if not a multisig?


[3/15/2024 8:26 PM] antonb
Protection Fund emissions are the only bucket that managed by multisig. (compute and community as well, until they are live)
If you check multisig rewards and put 4 at pool number, which is Protection Fund, you'll see that ~20k of MOR is emitted yet.

That is correct. The multisig does not receive Code Provider MOR rewards. MOR emissions for Coders go directly from the Smart Contract to the Code Provider's Ethereum address as based on the weight snapshot (list of addresses and weights).

Calling all testers.

## New Dashboard Improvements & MOR.ETH ENS Connection In Testing

Two important improvements in testing right now.

1. The "Wallet Connect" option has been added to the Capital Contributor Dashboard. You can test it out at this link.
https://morpheus-dev.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/#/mainnet/capital

2. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address for the Morpheus Dashboard is now live for testing MOR.ETH https://mor.eth/ which resolves to this IPFS link: ipfs://bafybeigseyyspeqqwn6jowefx23yvgrmndsftospsowajzfyowfl5hc76q/#/mainnet/capital

Thanks to the Smart Contract devs for their work on these improvements.

[3/20/2024 8:49 PM] dorianjanezic
Hi, I've laid out three key points of web3 interactions improvements. Please let me know if any of these are interesting to you so I can propose a more detailed tech stack and feature list.

**1. WalletConnect or RainbowKit for wallet interoperability:** WalletConnect and RainbowKit are both protocols designed to enhance interoperability between different cryptocurrency wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). These protocols enable users to securely connect their wallets to various dApps without compromising their private keys. By implementing WalletConnect or RainbowKit into a platform, users gain the flexibility to interact with different wallets seamlessly, reducing friction and improving the user experience. This interoperability is crucial in the decentralized ecosystem, where users may have preferences for different wallets based on factors like security, features, or supported cryptocurrencies.


[3/20/2024 8:50 PM] dorianjanezic
**2. Creation of burner wallets or AI-generated wallets: ** Burner wallets are temporary cryptocurrency wallets designed for short-term use, typically for specific transactions or interactions within a decentralized ecosystem. They are called "burner" because they're intended to be used for a limited time and then discarded or "burned." These wallets are convenient for casual users or those who want to minimize their exposure to potential security risks associated with long-term wallet storage. Allowing users to create burner wallets directly through a user interface (UI) simplifies the process and can enhance accessibility to blockchain applications. Additionally, incorporating AI to generate burner wallets can further streamline the process, providing users with secure wallets tailored to their preferences and usage patterns.

**3. Account dashboard for blockchain interactions**An account dashboard is a user interface feature that provides a comprehensive overview of a user's interactions with the blockchain. This dashboard typically displays essential information such as transaction history, wallet balances, activity logs, and any other relevant data related to the user's account. By offering an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, users can easily track their blockchain activities, monitor their assets, and analyze their transaction history. This transparency and accessibility empower users to manage their blockchain assets effectively and make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. Additionally, integrating features like transaction notifications or analytics tools can further enhance the functionality and utility of the account dashboard, providing users with valuable insights and improving their overall experience in the web3 ecosystem.

Hey guys im looking into how best to integrate morpehus with BSC since it has huge DAU and TVL

my question here is. What is the main yield bearing asset/ protocol?

I can see 2 options but not a mssive bsc user
1 - Venus: https://app.venus.io/ They offer liquid staking for BNB 
2 - Binance https://www.binance.com/en/ethereum-staking - they offer BETH or WBETH

Does anyone have any input here or looking to work on putting an MRC proposal together? Im in talks with the bsc team who are very happy to support the integration and also open to supporting the TCM conept more heavily and directing teams toward it

Which is closer to a Lido stETH equivalent in the BSC context? 
That yield from staking BSC would be the most stable type. 
Also needs to use the daily rebase of rewards type approach.
And yes as @antonb | will not DM you said it would be great to see an MRC for this.

Hi guys, I've been working on an unabridged architecture doc and it's about 90% done. 

I know a lot of devs have been asking how they can get involved. This document will outline in detail all the different building blocks. Once published we can chunk out and assign work. There will be a lot of need for solidity devs and ux/ui designers. 

Scott has the dev portal registry setup so if you want to get involved that's the best place to start.

You will update the weights table with your MR... we are still needing to add a weights table to our repo, that will happen shortly. 

If your weights look correct in correlation to the work being merged then it will be accepted. Otherwise we will reply with comment to adjust.

alternative is just to use string formatting, inputs are already strict, so its unlikely keywords would be included in a prompt.

I think the relationship between name and address can be handled in the prompt for a given model. Experimenting along these lines, each model needs to be give a slightly different prompt to get the desired responses.


[3/24/2024 2:51 PM] calebsheridan
Inside of node is a prompt that‚Äôs being injected before each user input.  There might be something in that area to explore


[3/24/2024 3:19 PM] 1272
yes thats where RAG is implemented.
alternatively, string formatting in the user prompt would use less context space.

Im just unsure of the tradeoffs between the two, and which approach would be best for this case.


[3/24/2024 3:21 PM] 1272
my first day learning about rag, I understand how its applied, just need to know when it should be.


[3/24/2024 3:27 PM] calebsheridan
Good point. lookup table, like an address book, before and after? Hexadecimal addresses are not handled very well


[3/24/2024 3:42 PM] 1272
there are tables for contract lookup being implemented already. look ing further into it. my understanding is these benefit more from RAG because contract names could be subjective, and there are a lot of them. string formatting might be the move, as long as error handling is robust.


[3/24/2024 3:43 PM] 1272
this would be similar to a list of payees, like you'd see on a bank app.
I think it would remain relatively small, so formatting the prompt should be ok.

Is there a good place to learn more about how Smart Agents ingest user queries and translate that into wallet interactions? I guess "Smart Agents Tools & Examples" is the relevant MRI, would love to know how that is being developed.

For instance I know there's the smart contract rank algorithm which can help in selecting the right DApp. But is there also an effort to "tag" different smart contracts so that an Agent knows where to go for what tasks?

I'm curious how much of this an AI is able to work out itself and how much needs to be recorded/tagged manually

only a few smart contracts which are trustworthy are being considered for now https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Lite-Client/tree/feature-dockerized-agent/agent-dockers/simple_eth_agent/rag_assets/contracts

you can see an implementation here regarding smart rank, which is mainly RAG on contracts, ABI functions, where these are coming from a trusted selection
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Lite-Client/blob/feature-dockerized-agent/agent-dockers/simple_eth_agent/main.py

basically the model is tasked with generating a wallet transaction
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Lite-Client/tree/main

Great to have this! I just finished a read, here are a few thoughts:
- I wonder if there is a need for separate model and agent registries. The way I think about it, it makes a lot more sense to have the two packaged together as just an "Agent". That way smart agent devs can tailor to a specific model and fine-tune outputs. Curious what @lachsbagel thinks
- In a talk of yours I watched (I think at the DeAI Summit) you painted more colour on how inference is paid for in sessions, with staking providing for cases where the user runs over the inference limit they have paid for. The doc touches on some of these ideas but I think it'd be great to spell them out more for those who didn't catch the talk (as always happy to help here!)


[4/5/2024 5:16 AM] rcondron
Great points, the agent and model registry could be combined... for now we kept them separate incase we need to version the agent registry more frequently as the tech evolves. (Still learning on this one) 

The session and inference payment system is simple on the surface in the papers but much harder to engineer and account for all the attack vectors. 

Currently working with a few engineers to expand this part of the paper. All that to say... more coming soon

Test net for distributed compute will be interesting and is more complex. Great tools like Bittensor, Edgellama, and others emerging. Morpheus is agnostic on how you preform the compute.

[12/2/2023 1:42 PM] smartagents
Well if you look at the Morpheus paper there isn't really a single event. 
Compute, Capital, Community and Coders all earn MOR tokens starting when the Mainnet go live via what amounts to mining. Its open and competitive for everyone to participate and goes on for the first 16 years for the first emissions "epoch", then if you look at the tail emissions it goes for at least 256 years.


[12/2/2023 1:43 PM] smartagents
The cap is 42 million MOR tokens emitted, but obviously with burning in the system the number will be something less than 42 million over time.

[12/3/2023 10:49 AM] smartagents
All good. What I like about the Morpheus paper is it created an incentive for Coders, Compute, Capital, and Community all on chain. So everyone gets rewarded for what they add to the network : )

For sure. Didn't know there is no affiliation to whitepaper creator.

Depends on the smart contract devs. I hear some folks in Europe are working on a smart contract that would be ready for late January, but it all depends on testing. If the test net goes live in a week or two then 30 days testing minimum would be good. The timeline should be driven by testing and avoid magic dates I think.

[12/3/2023 11:05 AM] smartagents
Going to have to see the Smart Contract open source code when they publish it before I know exactly how they coded it, but the paper makes it look like MOR tokens issued on Polygon. But stETH is on Ethereum.


[12/3/2023 11:05 AM] smartagents

[12/3/2023 11:06 AM] smartagents
The paper says its chain and layer agnostic so I'd like to see multiple good chains / layers supported over time.


[12/3/2023 11:06 AM] smartagents

[12/3/2023 11:06 AM] smartagents

Do you want fees to be $0.02 per transaction or $1.50 on average.


[12/3/2023 11:06 AM] kehndry
100% agree on fee structure


[12/3/2023 11:07 AM] kehndry
but like you say


[12/3/2023 11:07 AM] kehndry
arb > polygon


[12/3/2023 11:07 AM] smartagents
Polygon has a good community and a more market cap, perhaps more integrations, but I think most of the stETH is on Arb.


[12/3/2023 11:08 AM] smartagents
So we will see where it lands. Sounds like they are still working it out.


[12/3/2023 11:08 AM] kehndry

[12/4/2023 2:59 AM] smartagents
Right now testing out the local version of Morpheus is great. Looks like there will be a capital contributor testnet the a week or two. After that need more developers working on Window's install version of Morpheus and developing the APIs for connect decentralized compute. Edge Llama and Arkeo might be solutions for that.


[12/4/2023 3:00 AM] smartagents
Morpheus has no central team. It has open source code contributors I guess you could add a note to Github if you want to report and issue or make a pull request if you have a code to contribute.

With this update you don't need to download and install Ollama as step 2!


[12/5/2023 12:11 PM] smartagents
In fact Ollama is now coded into Morpheus. So DELETE Ollama to use the new Morpheus version 0.0.5


[12/5/2023 12:12 PM] smartagents
This is quite the milestone. Install Morpheus with a single drag and drop. Never touch a terminal, no technical knowledge required. Just download, drag and drop, start chatting.

Well finding bugs, reporting issues, making useful contributions to the code is being recorded in weights, that will translate into how the coding reward is calculated. The paper mentioned looking at Github and other sources to validate these contributions in public. Here is the link to the issues for Morpheus on Github. That might be a good place to start. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/issues

Morpheus local version is already live. Check out https://mor.org/ to download for Mac or Linux.

Also there are some devs working on a Smart Contract for the MOR token proposed in the paper.
Looks like testnet this month, then we will see how long it takes to test and audit properly before mainnet. Its all a Community process there is no team to set magic dates.

When the energy and desire from the community is there things just pop into existence. 
The SF KeepOpenAI party on DevDay got 700 people to show up just 24 hours after announcement.
Within a few weeks of posting about a Decentralize AI Summit the top protocols in the world showed up in Austin. No sponsors, all organically assembled from volunteers. Its wild right now. Erik, Beff, Balaji, Andreessen, all posting about the need for Decentralized AI.

@laurel make sure you have enough RAM its using a default 7 Billion Mistral parameter model so at least 14 gigs is needed to run it. I also had the issue when I tried to download it on a slow internet connection.

Should be enough. It would be good to default future versions to a smaller model or even detect how large a model people can use, lots of improvements to be made for sure.

[12/14/2023 9:09 PM] cybourgeoisie
General question: the definition of each of the 4C's all implies that the user is running a node and registering it. Is it possible for a single node operator to register for more than 1 of the 4Cs and be rewarded for multiple via the same node / address? A good example is a Coder who provides both Code & Community Building, or a Capital Contributor who is also providing Compute.


[12/14/2023 11:07 PM] smartagents
Good question. I don't see any reason a person couldn't use a single node or a single wallet address for that matter for multiple rewards streams from multiple types of work provided to the protocol.

[12/16/2023 1:11 AM] smartagents
@bdog Did you have a previous version of Morphues? If so you need to uninstall Ollama as its now included directly in Morpheus. Best to unstaill any previous version, uninstall Ollama, restart your computer and then downalod / install 0.0.5.

Hm. Not really sure what is going on tbh. I can download the AI models but Initializing Morpheus somehow ends up with an error message every time. 

Have Morpheus on a dedicated mac with nothing else on, so I actually reset the computer and went through the process again but still ending up with an "Error:  fetch failed" time and again.

Anyone has any suggestions how to fix this? Would be greatly appreciated

@Cryptic Yeah. Cool project.


[12/18/2023 10:56 PM] smartagents
Main difference here is Morpheus is about you, connecting your data, and your wallet to direct a "Smart Agent" that acts based on your intent and approval. Autonolas is more about the atonomous AI agent side of things. They may work well together. With your Smart Agent directing other agents and directing their actions to follow your intent.

GA! Is Morpheus open for new chain partnerships? Thanks!


[12/20/2023 12:21 AM] smartagents
@Emre | SKALE Morpheus is chain agnostic. Starting on Ethereum / Arbitrum, but the author's of the white paper were super clear. "We recognize strong builder communities on Arbitrum, Polygon, OP Stack, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polkadot, Solana, Filecoin & Cosmos that share a similar vision and values."


[12/20/2023 12:23 AM] smartagents
So given its all open source it would depend if there are developers eager to build out Morpheus functions on another chain. Personally I'd love to see Cosmos soon so Morpheus can use more Thorchain infrastructure and then perhaps Solana for high speed use cases. However it might be best to get one chain supported first before putting efforts into a 2nd or 3rd.

@AI Project Hub (œÑ, œÑ) @0xmiracle Depends on the models you want to offer. Its more about RAM than compute if you mainly want to offer language tokens for text inference. So figure at least 32 gigs for running a 14 Billion parameter model, 140 gigs for a 70 Billion parameter model and so forth.


[12/21/2023 1:39 AM] smartagents
@Batalalddurub I think different chains have different trade offs. Low fees are great, but having deep liquidity is also important. Speed is great, but having a lot of security and censorship resistence is important too. So it really depends on what use case. For liquidity Ethereum & Arbitrum have the most stETH and so that's a good place to start for the Capital Contributor aspect of Morpheus.

There are a bunch of repositories related to Morpheus. There is the local install, the Smart Contracts, the various Linux installs, and tons of work to be done on improving / testing all these. Jump on in, everyone is friendly, open and eager to collaborate.    
Maybe start with: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus and 
If you want back ground on Smart Agents this one: https://github.com/SmartAgentProtocol/SmartAgents @nauhc

For all of those looking to get Goerli ETH, I would recommend the following:
- go onto Layer Zeros testnet bridge. 
- Swap .001 ETH on an L2 (ARB, OP) for a couple of Goerli Eth. 

Will cost you a couple of bucks but will save a lot of headache.

[12/25/2023 10:57 AM] smartagents
All MOR emissions begin when the Smart Contracts go to main net. Even then just running a full node won't earn MOR tokens. Best to read the whitepaper. Describes how one can offer Compute for example via running LLMs that others can request prompts against the API. So while running a node is required to do this function, its a bit more than that. For Compute you have to offer your Compute to others.

Which one did you have in mind? I think the first thing would be to add the Smart Contracts to that chain, presuming its an EVM based chain. Again might make sense to get pasted the boot strapping phrase then the Smart Contracts will be more developed.

Bittensor is great. Akash is great. Morpheus Compute Providers can leverage ANY network they want or run all the metal and end points themselves. As I read the paper the goal for Morpheus is to bring together all the pieces of Compute and Code for the Smart Agents, and Community Built front ends, and Capital to provide liquidity. If you want to go deeper I'd recommend reading the Smart Agent white paper: https://github.com/SmartAgentProtocol/SmartAgents/blob/main/White%20Paper.md

Basically Morpheus is the Smart Agents what Ethereum is to Smart Contracts. Want to know more about Smart Agents check out the white paper below

[1/2/2024 11:15 PM] smartagents
There is no team, company, or central process to consider an integration to an EVM chain.
Thus some open source developer would have to create the integration and contribute it to the Morpheus Github.

However the starting point would be to think through and explain the reasons for an integration.
Is there some function or feature Morpheus users can't get from using Ethereum / Arbitrum Smart Contracts for Capital Provision for example?

Gm Morpheus community. I've been working on a revised model suggestion for the Compute portion of Morpheus' tokenomics. Here is the paper:

https://defiant-wolfsbane-830.notion.site/Morpheus-Yellowstone-Compute-Model-2ca9b4e7e1374c898937fdbd1b964cc1


The goals were to:
1. Remove the ability for compute providers to game the system 
2. Enable users to not pay per inference (ideally, to not pay at all)
3. Achieve efficient, scalable, and sustainable provision of permissionless compute resource *without* overpaying for it
4. Incentivize low response time and cost competition among compute Providers
5. Minimize number of blockchain transactions (whether L2 or otherwise)
6. Demonstrate an economically sound fundamental demand for MOR

Circulating here for community feedback.  Discussion should probably occur in #üíªÔ∏±compute-providers

> ‚ÄúLangToken‚Äù (‚ÄúLT‚Äù): defined as a language token in generative AI parlance. Often this is ~4 characters of text, or 5x5 pixels of image, etc. LTs are the base commodity being offered in Morpheus, not to be confused with ‚Äútokens‚Äù generally such as ERC20 tokens or the MOR token itself. ‚ÄúTokenMax‚Äù below refers to a maximum number of LangTokens accepted for payment by the Router.

this should be defined as tokens (BPE tokenisation) rather than characters of text or pixels. shouldn't it?

Byte pair encoding
Byte pair encoding (also known as digram coding) is an algorithm, first described in 1994 by Philip Gage for encoding strings of text into tabular form for use in downstream modeling. Its modification is notable as the large language model tokenizer with an ability to combine both tokens that encode single characters (including single digits or ...

@SmartAgents so with the current compute model only working with users having MOR tokens and Compute providers being rewarded for usage. 

Does this mean, with mainnet smart contracts going live for the bootstrapping period, the reward buckets will start emissions at different intervals?


[1/5/2024 12:31 PM] mahalleinirx
Capital and code first, then compute and community after bootstrapping, if so the emissions tables would not be accurate.

However, if they all start emissions at the same time then something will need to be done with the tokens from community and compute bucks during bootstrapping.

Is this something anyone is working on?


[1/5/2024 12:33 PM] smartagents
Its a good question. I've been presuming given the paper all the different MOR emissions start at the same time and that's the way the Smart Contracts are coded based on my review of their code.


[1/5/2024 12:34 PM] smartagents
So lets say the Compute emissions start building up and are awaiting the Router / Compute Smart Contract to be finalized as well as the boot strapping period to end before they can start paying out.


[1/5/2024 12:35 PM] smartagents
Seems like a logical parallel to the boot strapping period. Compute code is built out while MOR are building up in the system to be available to pay for the Compute when users demand it.


[1/5/2024 12:36 PM] smartagents
It would be great to have a way to do Compute during the 90 days of the boot strapping period to test out the APIs and everything. I've heard a few developers are looking at a solution for that. Still in development from what's I've read.

I'm trying to think of a solution that works with the yellowstone model, as I believe in the model it was an open question regarding that if there is not enough compute getting used how would the remainder of the emissions of that day will get distributed

I have a bunch of dedicated servers for my own projects. Did I understand correctly I can just run some nodes and earn some tokens? Any TLDR for what to expect per server? I see a compiled debian package, has anyone run this in docker (especially on an ubuntu host)?


[1/5/2024 10:15 PM] antonb
There are some suggestions and comments in the yellowstone paper on that.


[1/5/2024 10:16 PM] antonb
If you mean token, it's not live yet.


[1/5/2024 10:31 PM] antonb
As #üí≤Ô∏±capital-providers dedicated to expressing interest and my message most likely will flood from "interested"), I'll post it here.

I'm thinking of full node requirement for capital providers, is it really so critical? 
Capital is essential part of tokenomics, especially in early stage, as creates liquidity and demand for MOR which results in value for all participants and better MOR visibility.

Full node requirement for capital providers greatly raises entry threshold for users and I bet that low-mid bank won't participate so we end up with whale only game which is not good for decentralization either.

To sum up, if full node requirement revoked, this would help attract more users and more capital and raise overall interest to Morpheus.


[1/5/2024 10:34 PM] antonb
> So lets say the Compute emissions start building up and are awaiting the Router / Compute Smart Contract to be finalized as well as the boot strapping period to end before they can start paying out.

There is a risk that other contracts won't be finalized in time. I don't even mention that contracts need time to be audited by community or ideally, cybersecurity company.


[1/5/2024 11:42 PM] smartagents
This is a good point. I'll make a pull request to the Github on this point. The point about running a full node is not a technical requirement. The paper just assumes everyone is providing contributions in the four ways through the Morpheus interface because the Smart Agent is adding a wallet connection, Smart Contract connections in version 0.0.6 and version 0.0.7

"Full node requirement for capital providers greatly raises entry threshold for users "

Yeah def. As currently conceived, the Capital contract doesn't require anyone to run a node. Only requirement is to send stETH. I don't think anyone desires making it a requirement to run a node to provide capital in this way, though you're right the white paper sorta implied it.

@verisimilar is right. I reached out to Rakshak for clarification.  The base unit for AI measurement is inferences/second (IPS). To measure that in terms of text and pixels the word token is used. So Token Rate and Tokens per Second (TPS) can be used for bidding and evaluation. I‚Äôm writing-up something for Yellowstone consideration.   

Feels like adding the ‚Äú/sec‚Äù to Tokens/sec avoids the blockchain crossover confusion a little bit

Both Ethereum and Arbitrum for different aspects. Ethereum for minting. AMM on Arbitrum. Payments of MOR on Arbitrum to avoid high fees.

Okay, got it, makes total sense. ETH is the most secure EVM chain and in case if something happens with ARB, would it be possible to forward rewards to another chain? Or maybe, as we are using L0 bridge, user can withdraw rewards to any chain supported?

Sure, but the "How to test the Uniswap functionality" and the L0 testing includes a second network. It doesn't link to Arbitrum Sepolia, but to Mumbai and the L2TokenReceiver there. It was also only recently deployed and has activity from wallets that are equal to the owner, so it should be the right one?

I love Bitcoin. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Hobbyist for a long time. But one thing that I found difficult in Bitcoin is to know which ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù somebody was talking about. Are we talking about the ‚Äúcoin‚Äù Bitcoin, or the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù Bitcoin, or the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù with all the inscriptions?

If people ask ‚Äúwhat is Morpheus?‚Äù Is it an app, a smart contract, or computers with LLMs, or something else? To me, these three things are different and separate enough to need different terminology.


[1/11/2024 3:50 AM] antonb
Hi Jeff. You've raised interesting point and I'm not sure that's really possible to distinguish specific meanings of Bitcoin or Morpheus somehow. This is like word "culture" that also has multiple different meanings, but we always get the meaning depending on the context.
I'd bet that when someone says Morpheus, it means project as a whole unless other meaning is clarified.

That's true. Though maybe more of a feature than a bug. Its nice to have a single brand. People only have so much room in their mind share for a project. First having a single name that's easy to remember is key. I agree for the more tech savvy devs Yellowstone Compute could refer to the Router or the Smart Contracts for Compute. But I'm careful of seeing too much complexity.

Yeah. There is a mention of that in the white paper. But ultimately if the Smart Agent in Morpheus can detect "intent" of the user, it should be able to automatically match the proper agent to the action the user wants to take.

Hi, are current testers considered contributors in terms of receiving MOR tokens once live? If so, how is that tracked?


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] antonb
Based on the whitepaper explanations, I believe that capital provider smart contract testers are not considered as contributors.

Correct. Only mainnet counts. However testing helps speed up the launch and give you experience.

Just my guess, that ETH yield earned during bootstrapping will be paired with 4% MOR (51,444 MOR by day 90) from protection fund which will set initial price of MOR.

> Boot Strapping Period Phase 2
> As part of the broader bootstrapping period but may last longer than 90 days for Compute Providers and Community Builders the Smart Contracts will build up MOR tokens rewards from day 1. However the Smart Contracts will not distribute the MOR tokens to Compute Providers and Community Builders until the Compute Router and other details are developed by the community.
Could you please clarify some moments?
How will Compute Providers and Community Builders be able to earn rewards from day1 as there is no users who can use compute or call API? 
If there is unused MOR for community builders, what will happen to it and where will it be stored?

From the anons dropping a white paper in September, to a local version of Morpheus 0.0.1 released in October, to events in November, to a global Decentralized AI Summit and Smart Contracts in December, to audits in January to a launch in February. Amazing.

[1/14/2024 9:03 PM] smartagents
The Smart Contracts calculate 3,456 MOR tokens each day from day one for each of the types of Contributors. Code, Capital, Compute and Community. There is a clear way to reward Code & Capital. The design is now clear for Compute  (thanks to the Yellowstone paper), but the software must be written for the Compute Router and as you point out Compute can't get paid until the MOR tokens are sendable on day 91 and Community Builders (front ends, Agents) also depend on the MOR token being sendable first. So these two aspects logically would be in a second phase of the boot strapping.


[1/14/2024 9:08 PM] antonb
Thanks for the clarification.
Let's picture the situation when there is no compute providers and community eligible for rewards because of no demand as there is no users on day 1. Where will emitted MOR go?


[1/14/2024 9:12 PM] smartagents
There may be demand for IPS (Inference Per Second) during the boot strapping period, but any Compute Provided can't be rewarded in the bidding system of Yellowstone until day 91 or properly recorded until the Compute Router is live. It would be great to figure out a way to do this during the boot strapping period that can't be gamed. I don't have an obvious answer. Let's see what the community of coders / developers suggests.

One idea I had is to have the community leverage something like Akash for the Compute during boot strapping. It has the API end points, is a Morpheus friendly community, they are already making a Morpheus Ymil template. Question is more how to avoid gaming for example a bunch of fake demand from a Compute Provider paying themselves (that's what Yellowstone will solve).

As bootstrapping period doesn't imply a lot of demand for compute and frontends as only capital contracts are alive, Morpheus can keep compute and community emissions untouched until day 91, and then double emissions for 90 days to incentivize early stage of the network.

Hey Hey, 

Is there any way I could contact someone from a team? I am part of a DAO which just finished research and have a few questions that we need to clarify ^^


[1/14/2024 9:52 PM] weaboo0521
Congrats to community. I am wondering if there is a "escape hatch" for people who provide capital since capital providers have to lock their stETH for almost 3 months?


[1/14/2024 9:57 PM] antonb
Hey man. The thing is there is no team. Morpheus is the project that is building by community.


[1/14/2024 9:57 PM] antonb
But you can ask your qs here and some folks will pick them up


[1/14/2024 10:00 PM] antonb
What do you mean by "escape hatch"? You will be able to withdraw your sETH at any time.

[1/14/2024 10:03 PM] weaboo0521
Ok, seems like I misunderstand? I thought all stETH in bootstrapping phase1 are locked for 90 days since I read this:
> stETH and MOR tokens will not be claimable / sendable until day 91 after phase 1 of the bootstrapping period is complete for Code & Capital Providers.


[1/14/2024 10:06 PM] weaboo0521
"Escape Hatch" is giving people have a option to withdraw their funds due to some unexpected risks happen such as smart contract vulnerability.


[1/14/2024 10:06 PM] antonb
Need @SmartAgents to confirm, but I'm almost sure that only MOR token will not be claimable / sendable until day 91.


[1/14/2024 10:08 PM] antonb

Yes, but the only thing I am concerning about is the stETH during bootstrapping. I don't know if it is special during bootstrapping phase 1 since the announcement said so. IMO it is reasonable to let capital provider to withdraw their stETH at anytime during fair launch and let them cannot harvest MOR. 
Having no way to transfer their stETH for 90 days will make some people worried about their asset security.

but want to confirm, we can start depositing stETH (assuming everything stays on schedule) on Feb 8th, but $MOR tokens won't be claimable/tradeable until 91 days after?

Do you know if we'll be able to deposit wstETH on Arbitrum? Or only stETH on main net?


[1/15/2024 1:57 AM] antonb
stETH is deposited on Ethereum mainnet and MOR rewards are claimed on Arbitrum. You might want to test the process to get better understanding.

[1/16/2024 4:00 AM] antonb
The Capital Provider Smart Contract will provide 50% of the stETH yield produced to the Morpheus swap function. The swap buys the MOR tokens from an Automated Market Maker (AMM) then pairs them with 50% of the stETH yield and lock into the AMM Liquidity Pool as protocol owned liquidity.

Not yet. Any proposals on selling MOR tokens are obvious scam.


[1/16/2024 3:18 PM] birbs69
go multichain if you want but if its arb only it severely caps val ceiling


[1/16/2024 3:19 PM] birbs69
i cant see an arb token >500m in mc anytime soon save for peak peak bull


[1/16/2024 3:20 PM] birbs69
and if you decide to bridge token to eth after some time it might be too late

tx cost is tx cost but you're paying in valuation premia


[1/16/2024 3:22 PM] birbs69
top arb native coin is xai at 300m mc


[1/16/2024 3:22 PM] birbs69
magic is also at 300m


[1/16/2024 3:24 PM] antonb
Again, it's just my thoughts. I believe that tx cost is critical and their price in most usage cases will fall on end users which will lead to higher service cost which in turn, critical to gain mass adoption.

[1/16/2024 3:29 PM] antonb
I'm not arguing with you or trying to convince you, just share my thought and I have full understanding of such decision of devs and support it. Having MOR on Ethereum would just give out a massive part of projects' value to validators in the form of fees.


[1/16/2024 3:30 PM] birbs69

That seems to be where most of the stETH is right now. Plus for the real utility of MOR tokens everyone wants low cost fees to send transaction for $0.01 USD.

"please launch MOR on eth
ARB coins have lower liquidity, lesser mindshare, and lower val ceilings" @Birbs 

MOR *will* be launched natively on ETH L1

It will also be bridged into Arbitrum and most transactional use for the protocol will occur there for gas reasons.  The protocol owned liquidity from the capital contract will flow into the AMM on Arbitrum. 

But yeah if you want to hold ETH L1 MOR you certainly can, and I agree liquidity for an L1 token is much higher and it's good that MOR will exist at the base layer.

The number of token holders and low entry threshold for new users is also about decentralization. From this point Arbitrum with low fees is a preferred option.

I still can't get how Ethereum launch makes project more successful in comparison to Arbitrum? I don't think that users (not traders) are willing to pay $50-100 fee instead of $1-2

looked through many of the docs - is there any point in setting up a local compute node? just seems like commercializing this for efficiency in a farm would quickly crowd out solo miners (much like btc)

A min amount of capital provision is 0.01 ETH which is ~$25 in present prices. Even this little amount over time can generate a decent profit for you.

From my understanding 

Currently it‚Äôs testnet 

Mainnet is the 8th?


[1/21/2024 8:49 AM] freeman8008
nodes for compute providers most likely won't be available Feb 8th. Feb 8th will begin a 90 day bootstrapping event on mainnet


[1/21/2024 8:49 AM] freeman8008
bootstrapping will be for capital providers

[1/21/2024 12:56 PM] mahalleinirx
Less people contributing during the early stages would be the benefits as emissions are distributed daily


[1/21/2024 12:57 PM] wyu
so people who contribute on day 1 will get more $MOR than lets say someone who contributed on day 70


[1/21/2024 12:57 PM] wyu
due to daily emissions, correct?


[1/21/2024 1:19 PM] mahalleinirx
Correct, if I contribute day 1 the pool would be less diluted most likely, not only that the emissions are calaculated daily so if you have it vesting for 70 days longer you will of course have more MOR

I noticed Filecoin was mentioned as storage.. Has anyone looked into SIA.. They are much more decentralized than FC and have been around for quite a while. Have been doing a lot of improvements into their infrastructure, although it's a separate L1. Could be worth looking into if they fit the bill


[1/22/2024 1:45 AM] smartagents
SIA is cool. I've tried Storj and all the others. However Filecoin / IPFS has most of the market share / mind share for Smart Contracts, so best to start there and add others as those communities want to do the work to extend their capabilities to Morpheus. Its a good filter. If the devs are passionate about an integration it will happen. If not it doesn't.

makes sense. SIA should be back to providing a lot more storage for IPFS actually, so in the end it is them lol. I think their dev team still has a lot of work on the core product before reaching out for more integrations but that path makes sense

Might be. I think Community members have been engaging Auditors and other auditors volunterring and I've heard it from multiple people. But I'm really happy with the testing so far. Seems the Smart Contract devs have done a great job and only minor issues identified so far. The more testing the better.

Hi guys, I'm new here and think this is an amazing project.
I got a few questions which are not 100% clear to me yet (small brain) after reading some chat msgs here.
1. From Feb 8th on I can provide capital via stETH via a website and earn MOR from emissions which are claimable 3 months later?
2. I read something about nodes, does it mean I can provide computing/cpu power from Feb 8th on? I would like to run a node, can I setup one via AWS or AZURE? What are the requirements?
3. May 8th the MOR token will be launched, right? Is it done via uni?

Thanks a lot for your feedback


[1/22/2024 3:16 AM] antonb
Hi Stoked. Gonna try to address your interest in Morpheus.

1) Not sure will the stETH deposit be through UI or contract, but you are totally right that MOR tokens will be claimable after 90 days of bootstrapping period.
2) Most likely compute contracts will be ready around the end of bootstrapping period as they are in active development right now. I'd suggest to follow and join discussion in #üíªÔ∏±compute-providers for more details.
16 gb RAM 16gm VRAM and 4 core should run most smaller-mid models
3) That's the plan, but please, bear in mind there are lots of moving parts and timelines can move a bit. Details on specific AMM for LP have not been announced yet.

Hope it helps üòâ

I am wondering about comunity builders and code providers - for both: how are their contributions validated and rewarded? There arent any objective validation methods here or am I wrong?


[1/22/2024 4:34 AM] infiniteatman
- 3,456 tokens for code. Proof code committed and merged into Morpheus repo.
- 3,456 tokens for community. Proof of building front end applications & tools that engage users. 

how are both these evaluatued permissionlessly / transparently ?


[1/22/2024 4:42 AM] smartagents
Good question. You can see the growing list of contributions here.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md
Its all on Github and thus public & transparent. 
As for Permissionless its all open source so certainly everyone can offer Code.
Though the repository lead is only likely to merge in Code of value at a reasonable number of hours. That's the check and balance.

okay will read up on both. But top down can you sum up the concept to make sure this cannot be gamed / ddosed?


[1/22/2024 4:54 AM] smartagents
Sure. The activity rewarded is on chain. I.E. the usage of the Smart Agent.
Front End builders are rewarded pro-rata (in proportion) to the usage of their application as proven by MOR transaction fees. The reward is less than the fees, so you can "game it" as long as you are willing to spend more money than you make : )

Its the App Store model minus the 30% to Apple or the permission to build : )

Guys, I have three questions:

2. Will buying $mor tokens possible from 8th february from the Open market via dex or OTC? (For example from Computer/node Providers?) Or will $mor Tokens be available after 90 days of the bootstrapping Period?
3. Can I run a node with a simple personal Computer?

Hi Paul.
1) It's in the WP https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/WhitePaper.md

3. I think it depends on the configuration of your PC, but most of modern laptops should run a node easily. You can find useful links and guides here #üìöÔ∏±verified-links 
4. It explained in the WP. I don't think anything additional will be implemented, as admin keys will be burned at some moment in the future, meaning no changes can be made. But while Morpheus is being developing, you can suggest improvements to tokenomics.


[1/22/2024 10:14 PM] paulberg3895
Great thx: will all node providers get the Same amount of mor or is it depending on gpu Power?


[1/22/2024 10:17 PM] antonb
Running node itself doesn't make you eligible for MOR rewards. You need either provide computation or build something useful on top of Morpheus that will be in demand.

Good questions. While anyone can offer code a Repo owner doesn't have to merge it. If the person is asking too many hours for the Contribution or the quality of the contribution can't be qualified or is of low quality its likely to be rejected. And while anyone "can" make a repository it takes a lot of work to maintain and also attract people to contribute to your repository over others, so the market is likely to focus on the best repositories with the most contributors and the best code resulting.

To be clear, the concept is here is NOT based on the Labor Theory of Value. It doesn't matter how many hours are worked but rather the value produced by the work. That's where the Repo owner has to merge in the product of the work and gauge the hours as the "customer" in the marketplace. Open source and Free market economics for the win.

okay, but lets say someone puts up a piece code and asks for n amount of work hours / compensation - how do you protect the code? How can you stop someone from just copying that code and putting it up for fewer hours etc. etc.? doesnt that require code to be closed sorce - at which point you cant evaluate the quality? I dont understand this point frankly...


[1/23/2024 4:36 AM] smartagents
That's a good question. 
1. Well if a Coder was say working on something with a lot of hours they might want to contact the repo owner and discuss interest first before spending all the time on it.
2. The Coder could put the code and the request for hour approval / address for rewards into the same Pull Request so the whole thing is accepted or rejected together.
3. The Coder could start with a restrictive license and offer to flip it to the MIT open source standard if accepted.
Seems like those type of best practices will emerge.

Hey everyone! Just read through the Protection Fund details. Just have a few points that might be worth discussing.
The general goal in emergency situations should be to be able to mitigate damage asap (e.g. halt contracts), but be slow on coming to "consensus" about next steps. I don't think that there's any considerably urgency involved here.
If you report a bug it doesn't really matter if you get paid in a day or in like 3 days. Same for providers if they don't receive emissions. Not perfect obviously, but totally fine in an outlier situation. Even for user losses. Obviously there's a bit more urgency here, but it shouldn't be rushed either.
In any of these cases it's important to be able to instantly mitigate further damage, which should be relatively centralized at first.
The following discussion and repayment / compensation process can be way slower. So what I'm trying to say is that from my point of view there's no need to have a mechanism like "In this case, rather than make a payout of MOR the Code Providers should deploy new Smart Contracts and correct the MOR balances effected manually" fully set up. There should be some social consensus on how to handle those situations, but I'm not sure if it should directly be executed.

I'm also wondering whether it makes sense to have an additional emergency layer for checks and balances? 
"If a majority of Code Providers (as measured by the weight of their MOR tokens held) which participate in the Signaling period (no longer than 7 days) validate the report as TRUE then a payment will be triggered."
Not everyone will be a Code Provider. Maybe normal token holders get a veto right, even if just for a short period of time?
The veto structure allows to not have a significant loss of efficiency (don't need to go through general token holder votes all the time), while making sure that power in those situations is not given to one type of ecosystem participant only.

Just thinking out loud for now!

@SmartAgents
Some feedback/questions on detailed protection fund management proposal:

1) Did I understand correctly that the fund plans to keep 50% in MOR and 50% in stETH, as well as place funds in the liquidity pool? If this is true, then in the event of an incident with the MOR contract, there is a risk of depreciation of the token due to strong sales pressure and, as a result, a significant decrease in the solvency of the fund.

2) I would like to have a clearer understanding of which actions are planned to be automated by a smart contract, and which and by whom will be carried out manually.

3) Decisions will be made by majority of code providers (measured by the weight of their MOR tokens held). To avoid situations where the decision can be made by one (or few) person (if he has 51% of the weight), it may be worth also adding a quorum in number of voters, for example, no less than 1/3 of the total number of code providers.

In general, I would like to propose not to rush into decentralization and the development of contracts, but instead, for some time, manage fund in the DAO format or by code providers or by all holders of MOR tokens, through snapshot.org
This will provide an opportunity to better understand the needs and problems that will be faced and, as a result, the best way to organize the work of the protection fund.

1) I think that in time it should be removed and converted back to pure MOR 

2) agreed that needs to be clearer

3)  I think this is a good stipulation that should be discussed 

I think full decentralisation shouldn't be rushed, and that core contributors should have most say and not all MOR holders by snapshot; as that would be full decentralization.

[1/23/2024 10:43 PM] yilmaz0707
And when can we buy the mor token on uniswap?


[1/23/2024 10:44 PM] smartagents
Thanks for the detailed notes.
1. I think the halt conditions for the Smart Contracts is a good point that is worth adding.
2. When it comes to the scenario where losses exceed the Protection Fund, I think the "hard fork" scenario is important to address.
3. The Veto right can be an attack vector. Say someone buys up enough tokens to trigger the veto and then does an attack that they can veto the fix for. Its happened before. The Code contributions are the slowest to earn of all the types and so its much more unlikely that a bad actor will work for years to earn their way into the Coding rewards to then do an attack and the very value they earned. VS the super fast attack of borrowing a bunch of tokens to do a governance attack.
4. I don't think of the Coders acting as "consensus" but rather as an oracle function. So its binary. Did the attack happen or not and how to mitigate it. The Coders are in the best position to address both.

I've updated the Github with a few of these suggestions.

[1/23/2024 10:51 PM] smartagents
You can buy 91 days after February 8th 2024 (the end of the bootstrapping period) is the current estimate. Depends on the audits and the Smart Contract devs.


[1/23/2024 11:00 PM] smartagents
Thanks for the detailed feedback.

1. Yes thats a good reason to have the Protection Fund in multiple assets. If the stETH are effected than having the 50% in stETH is good, if the MOR are effected than having 50% in MOR is good. I understand and agree if MOR is effected then the value is likely to be effected too, but that's why its good to have a non correlated assets like stETH. 

2. I don't know if any of these Protection Fund actions can be automated today. Its presumed they will be manual by the Code Providers.

3. Quorums can be tricky. Most projects are lucky if 5 or 10% of their users participate in the vote.

Agreed. Decentralization is the goal and the direction the project should move over time. Start with the best approach possible and go from there.

I'm skeptical of the board use of DAOs though I could be convinced that a very narrow application of one for say other the Protection Fund mechanisms could make sense. But only if it proves impossible to do with an atomic / individual approach.

There is no private or public sale as well as premine. It's fair launch and you can start earning MOR by providing stETH on 8th of Feb


[1/23/2024 11:13 PM] smartagents
Last note. I realized it would be really important to have the Protection Fund provide resources for audits before new Smart Contracts launch.


[1/23/2024 11:15 PM] smartagents
So that's the Protection Stack.
1. Fund audits to avoid bugs.
2. Fund bug bounties to resource white hat hackers to report bugs.
3. Halt the Smart Contracts in case of on going attack.
4. Pay out effected users / providers in case of loss.
5. Hard fork conditions in case of large scale issue.

Definately fair launch. No tokens exist before February 8th. Everyone can start earning them then. 90 days until they unlock. Read about the boot strapping period. 1.2 Million MOR is the emissions rate for all MOR earned for Code, Capital, Compute and Community. 14,400 times 90 days with the decay rate included.


[1/24/2024 3:38 AM] boom0864
So any tokens bought during fair launch, there is a 90 day lock before they can be claimed?


[1/24/2024 3:40 AM] smartagents
0 MOR tokens can be bought the first 90 days (there is no sale). 
But those who Contribute stETH yield can EARN MOR and claim them on day 91.

MOR is claimable starting day 91.

[1/24/2024 5:20 AM] mxm04_
Amazed at what I've read so far. Gonna spend the rest of the night reading up on more.

Just one quick question if someone wouldn't mind clarifying please (for my own peace of mind). If I send my stETH over to ETH L1, is that all I need to do in prep for the launch to begin providing? I'll suck up paying the fees as I don't want to miss out, but I just want to make sure it has to be the L1 and that I can't use ARB instead for staking the stETH?


[1/24/2024 5:22 AM] antonb
Correct, you provide stETH on L1 and claim MOR on Arb


[1/24/2024 5:23 AM] antonb
Might be a good idea to try the process on testnet. You can find a  guide on Github

Hey y'all, It was great to meet some of you at the Decentralized Ai summit. I building an inference layer for decentralized Ai and plan to offer decentralized compute to Morpheus at launch.

Our website looks very web2 and that's because we've built this inference protocol in a way that allows large companies with distributed GPU clusters to run their own internal decentralized Ai network so that we can get real use cases and real revenue in the door, but we're planning to take that core inference engine and run it via a blockchain protocol. The site is AiLayer.ai

No advantage. Just a limit of the current tech stack. Morpheus local install uses Ollama. Ollama only has support for Linux and Mac at the moment. Have a good windows alternative to Ollama? Feel free to post it in the Code Providers channel. https://ollama.ai/download

In short, protection fund emissions for first 90 days (51,444 MOR by day 90)  will be utilized for creating protocol owned liquidity by pairing with stETH yield generated for the same period.

[1/24/2024 7:31 PM] antonb
Not really, the term called TCM (techno capital machine) and Morpheus is the first project which is pioneering it. 
I can share a doc with in depth explanation, but if you need just a simple answer, you are getting MOR rewards by allowing Morpheus spend yields generated by your stETH (not stETH itself) to create Protocol Owned Liquidity.

Hi. I'd suggest to start with #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs and read whitepapper after.
Morpheus doesn't provide rewards for just running a node, but you can be a compute provider or community builder, i.e. build apps, tools, agents users could use.

If you look at the emissions curve the decay rate gets you to about 16 years of MOR emissions and the max supply of 42,000,000 MOR.

Ok, not to point you out, I just want to make sure I understand the process. But I believe your hours currently make up close to 250 hours - 17% of the entire hours on the Code Contribution doc. I'm curious if you committed any code or if all of those were based on calls, reaching out to other communities and devs, etc.. I'm not asking you to justify here but I'm curious how you prove and validate all of that when you make the Pull request. So others can follow suit.

The is no token sale and no private sale. 
Only fair launch. Check the Capital Provider section of the white paper. You can offer stETH starting February 8th to the Smart Contract and it will contribution the stETH yield (rebased amount) to the Protocol Owned Liquidity and you will get MOR tokens pro-rata to everyone else doing the same thing.

[1/26/2024 12:01 AM] smartagents
Might make sense at some point in some fashion. Layer 2 or Cosmos App chain. But its pretty great to be able to get all the security, consensus and execution of Ethereum for pennies per transaction on Ethereum / Arbitrum vs having to spend a ton of the emissions on those things. Instead Morpheus can reward Inference for AI Smart Agents, Code for the platform, Front End Inferfaces and Capital for liquidity.

Yeah as soon as you can connect Morpheus to your wallet you will be able to take some of the actions like send stETH transactions using your personal AI. But its not required. You can use a different wallet or dashboard if you want.

Also, I wouldn't ignore the fact that there are only a little over 1000 people on the server, which gives us an advantage over when there are tens of thousands here. Even with 1 ETH, you can now earn tens of times more MOR than when the Morpheus gets deserved traction

I'm happy to report that the dedicated audit of the Smart Contracts for Morpheus has been completed and all issues have been fixed by the Smart Contract developers and confirmed by the auditors as having been successfully closed. Big thanks to @Christopher  (Morpheus) for engaging the auditors and leading that process and contributing all the resulting code to the community.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/Testing%20Reports/report-v2%20of%20Morpheus%20Audit.pdf

As a result the February 8th 2024 proposed date for the move to Ethereum / Arbitrum seems to stil be the most likely date for the beginning of the fair launch.

Yes, but next question, who is developing your smart agents, will their be a registry on-chain to contribute code? Secondly how will these smart agents be incentive aligned and redundant. For example, Olas currently has a registry were devs can submit canonical code that form the basis for services ran by agents. How is Morpheaus providing these building blocks? Moreover, Olas allows devs to mint their code contributions and then receieve rewards for if this code is utilized in a service. As you can imagine, this code-capital relationship is a great way to incentivize devs to contribute code for protocol expansion. And my third point, what framework will Morpheus use to allow agents to speak to another for within a service of function. Olas uses, but not exclusively the Open-AEA framework built by David Minarsh. Will Morph agents be using this same library?

Many of these questions are answered in the Docs.
Tl:dr.
1. Yes registry.
2. Smart Rank algorithm.
3. Yes agentic behavior.
4. Human augmented intelligence, not autonomous.
5. The fundamental of the Smart Agent framework is the human providing intent, the AI understanding that intent, proposing an action and the Human authorizing the action via Web3 wallet.

I just read the smart agent doc


[1/28/2024 4:07 AM] antonb
I don't have deep tech knowledge, so it's solely my guess, could it be so that Smart Agents are just "human language" name for "API LLM wrappers connected to wallets that will abstract a way some functions much like intention-based infrastrcuture"?


[1/28/2024 4:09 AM] postgoa
Yeah but what about the trust assumptions, who's governing how these APIs interact with your wallet, also like just using an LLM API doesn't mean it's an agent


[1/28/2024 4:09 AM] postgoa
That's just like connecting and API prompt to your wallet


[1/28/2024 4:10 AM] postgoa

[1/28/2024 4:12 AM] antonb

[1/28/2024 4:12 AM] postgoa
I guess the question is which humans are aduting the smart agents and how can we make this process trustless?


[1/28/2024 4:15 AM] antonb
Ok, let me rephrase your question from PoV of average user. 
How can someone trust that Smart Agent connected to its wallet will work as intended and, let's say, drain your wallet at some moment?

The thing I'd say Morpheus is providing is a place to bring together all the pieces of a personal AI.


[1/28/2024 5:20 AM] smartagents
I want my context and data to be persistent across all the Dapps, Smart Contracts and Agents I interact with.

[1/28/2024 5:22 AM] postgoa
Basic "current" intent infrascture can be ported to Morph and access through your personal assitant


[1/28/2024 5:22 AM] smartagents
That's a way of thing of it.


[1/28/2024 5:23 AM] smartagents
I think as the Agents begin to mature they will get more complex and be able to take more interesting actions on your behalf.


[1/28/2024 5:23 AM] smartagents
Over time the intend you express might be able to rise to a higher level then narrow directions.


[1/28/2024 5:23 AM] smartagents
And having a Smart Agent that is aware of this growing eco-system of other agents but is tasked with working on YOUR behalf is the key.


[1/28/2024 5:23 AM] postgoa
Yeah well that's what's currelty missing because from all I've read there still lacks agency and self-governance within the Morph system.


[1/28/2024 5:24 AM] postgoa
I think once we move past just an LLM assistant that executes basic on-chain functions through text prompts we enter more complex relationships and trust assumptions


[1/28/2024 5:25 AM] smartagents
The individual provides agency. Morpheus is not attempting an anonymous agent that has its own agency. The Smart Agent concept has the human at its heart, provding will, goals, tasks, intent and approval.


[1/28/2024 5:26 AM] postgoa
Okay, so this is a fudmental differentwe between Olas and Morph


[1/28/2024 5:26 AM] smartagents
Correct.


[1/28/2024 5:26 AM] postgoa
Which is what I've been comparing; and btw I'm really not trying to downgrade Morph, just trying to figure out what makes it agentic


[1/28/2024 5:26 AM] postgoa
And so far, it's not agentic


[1/28/2024 5:26 AM] postgoa
It's more intention-centric


[1/28/2024 5:28 AM] smartagents
Maybe so. We shall see how it evolves. But yes it has a different fundamental framework from Olas or Singularity. I believe there is pretty of room for different approaches. Morpheus is going for the human centered Augmented Human Intelligence approach.


[1/28/2024 5:29 AM] smartagents
AHI.


[1/28/2024 5:29 AM] postgoa
Although I think that's noble. I believe its a rudimentary step in regards to improving UI for users on blockchain. This, because the future will be automated services with some level of autonomy so that the end user is not burdened with managing xyz, and can use his time more wisely by taking a meta approach to managing his on-chain life.


[1/28/2024 5:30 AM] postgoa
However, I think there is a need to improve the UI for end users, and wrapping LLMS to API specific to blockchain is a good first start


[1/28/2024 5:31 AM] postgoa
I think MORPH will be valuable as incentive for people to build these APIs however, they will also be competing with Dapps who will add the API's themselves to their protocols--think of 1-click vaults


[1/28/2024 5:34 AM] smartagents
Fair points. I think the fact that Morpheus can be implemented right now with no fundamental breakthroughs is a smart approach as it creates a basis from which to grow. Agreed making the user experience of Crypto / Web3 easy for the masses is an important unlock in of itself. 

As to the point of if every Dapp will do these integrations themselves or use tools built by the Morpheus community, I'd point to IPFS and other examples where while yes Devs could make their own standard for file storage, its orders of magnitude easier to just use a well maintained tool built by others. Oracles would be a similar example. 

Devs could make their own ChainLink framework, but that's a lot of work. I think all the integrations and management of Models, APIs, Compute, Capital related to AI will be a lot of work and Morpheus community can do that work on behalf of many developers, who then don't have to spend the time or develop that expertise themselves.

I agree that centralizing intent-infrastructure to a community run network with incentives to build., as well as centering the infrastructure on LLMs, is probably one of the best ways of changing the UI for end users in the space.

How compossible will they be outside of the MORPH network. I imagine they are composible


[1/28/2024 5:44 AM] smartagents
Composible is key for all things on Ethereum. Early enough that the community can build in that direction.


[1/28/2024 5:46 AM] postgoa
So then will these API-LLM's be strapped to MORPH, like can other dapps use them without needing MOR?


[1/28/2024 5:50 AM] smartagents
Depends on how they are built out. The dividing line is local versions require no token, network activity requires the MOR token to pay those providing that infrastructure. The way to pay for Compute, Community (front ends), Capital, and Code is via MOR. Everyone pays gas via ETH, storage via FIL, oracles via LINK, I expect as a public good on a blockchain Morpheus will be very similar.


[1/28/2024 5:51 AM] postgoa
In this sense we can view Morph as an off-chain API layer


[1/28/2024 5:52 AM] postgoa
Other protocols could call Morph API-LLM wrappers that execute certain functions (they've been coded to swap x for z based on data from an LLM)

Its on chain. But certainly could have off chain connections. Filecoin is a good example, much of the activity is off chain, but the payments, proofs and other aspects related to incentives and audits are on chain.


[1/28/2024 5:58 AM] smartagents
Yeah clearly for calling functions related to requesting cheap Compute for Inference (either for prompts or training), specifying Models, triggering / payment for Agents, SmartRank API for calling against the marketplace of audited / ranked agents.

One thing I'm struggling with is why tie these API-LLM functions to the Morph network at all. I suppose you do this to incentivize their development.


[1/28/2024 6:04 AM] postgoa
But they almost seem more valuable as building blocks rather than strapped to an AI assistant


[1/28/2024 6:04 AM] postgoa
Like metamask, rabby, or other popular wallest could just call these APIS for abstraction with LLM enhancements


[1/28/2024 6:06 AM] smartagents
Morpheus is fairly modular. You don't have to use any part that isn't useful to a particular use case. Though the system gives everyone the option to run their own full node if they want. Many will just use lite clients or APIs and thats ok.


[1/28/2024 6:11 AM] postgoa
Sorry if this is redundant, but lets say Metamask wants to use an LLM-API (smart agent contract) on morph as a swap aggregator, because the contracts, through it's use of LLM, has the best rates in the space, does Metamask pay morph to access this API?


[1/28/2024 6:11 AM] paulberg3895
How does Morpheus make it technically possible that everyone can run the assistant on their own computer?


[1/28/2024 6:12 AM] postgoa
You run a node that provides a localized version of an open source LLM, which you then lock your data to securely

It would seem so. Someone has to run the API and get paid to do so. If anything has no cost it gets a DOS attack.


[1/28/2024 6:14 AM] postgoa
Yes of course, okay well this makes sense then. Currently, we have some AIFI protocols that provide API's-Linked to models for specific functions. We have Hera and Mozaic. But Morph will allow people to build their own versions of these, although since they will use open-sourced models we have to imagine they won't be as competitive as highly trained closed source version. But that's okay because Morph will allow them to be composible with one another forming network effects.

But how can a node of a network provide a local version of a LLM. Hasn't it to be connected to the network in any way then?


[1/28/2024 6:26 AM] smartagents
Two modes. Local and network. If you download the full LLM on your compute (14 gigs) you don't have to call for Inference from anyone else and can prompt the model for text answers to your hearts content. On the other hand if you want to do an action that you don't have the hardware for, say make a high quality image or video with a GPU, then you can ask the Morpheus network for that Compute. If you hold a MOR balance you will have daily Inference available to you.

Was easier to launch on ETH/ARB because of the yield available, was going to launch on ThorChain but due to fundamental issues with the architecture it was not possible to provide yield in the suggested manner yet, however, since Morpheus can be chain agnostic we are looking into all ecosystems

No if you withdraw you will continue earning MOR based on the amount of stETH you deposited weighted by how long it was deposited.


[1/29/2024 2:09 AM] 0xdystopian

50+ auditors applied and that's the one the sponsor selected. I don't think online social media usage equals experience. Also this audit is just one of the many testing steps. Internal testing by developers, then community testing, Open Zeppelin testing templates applied, then dedicated auditor, and next another open public auditor process and bug bounty. Keep testing friends.

You can withdraw your stETH during the boot strap period. Just MOR tokens aren't claimable until day 91.


[1/29/2024 2:39 AM] mahalleinirx
I was curious as if there is a specific time the stETH is locked for or is it just that there is a specific time I need to wait before I withdraw to make sure I secure rewards, my assumption is the latter

thanks! Interested in participating love the concept


[1/29/2024 2:47 AM] smartagents
Its one of the last questions. Presumption has been 24 hours, but might have to be 48 hours + a few minutes. Needs to be long enough that the user actually contributes stETH yield (which is only done once per day at 12 midnight UTC time via Lido rebasing), short enough to be easy to deposit and withdraw when you want. 

The thing that has to be avoided is people playing a game of depositing and withdrawing at a time that will get them MOR but skip the next rebasing period. The longer the lock up of stETH the less people can try and game the system, but it inserts unwanted friction in the deposit and withdraw period.

Of course fees and gas costs reduce the incentive to play this game, but its worth thinking through. One approach would be to start with a longer stETH lock up period and reduce it over time or update the Smart Contract to sync the MOR reward and rebasing interval. Block time vs rebasing interval.


[1/29/2024 2:52 AM] mahalleinirx
I was having similar thoughts about this, was thinking a random timing  within a 48hr period would prevent gaming rebase, another thought was longer lockup period to begin with


[1/29/2024 3:03 AM] antonb
> Presumption has been 24 hours, but might been to be 48 hours + a few minutes. 
Could it be not an exact number like 24 or 48 hours, but time (a few mins) after 12 midnight UTC? 

> game of depositing and withdrawing at a time that will get them MOR but skip the next rebasing period. 
What would incentivize them to do so except of protocol attack?

> update the Smart Contract to sync the MOR reward and rebasing interval. Block time vs rebasing interval.
Do you mean daily reward calculation (instead of per block) after rebasing?

1. Maybe. Might be a little more complicated to calculate. When avoiding bugs simplicity is king.
2. Just wanting more MOR tokens but skipping on providing the yield. Say you put in the stETH and pulled it out just before midnight UTC, you get credit for the time deposited (calculated by blocks) but you cheated the protocol out of the yield. Repeat. So there has to be SOME amount of lock up to avoid people gaming it, question is how long. You could do 7 days and it would make the gaming really inefficent, but you might turn away more people because of the longer lock up than the protection is worth.
3. Right that would be one way to avoid it.

As you said morp will be distributed for the first 90 days via code, capital, compute and community but how will mor for compute be distributed since you need morp to run the computation node and there won't be any tokens for first 90 days


[1/29/2024 2:56 PM] mahalleinirx
There have been more than one audit as far as I know there has been 5


[1/29/2024 3:34 PM] antonb
Compute and Community rewards will start accrue from Day 1 and distributed when corresponding contracts are live. Until then MOR rewards are stored in the distribution contract.


[1/29/2024 3:35 PM] notmrhuman
So how will they be distributed on day 91?


[1/29/2024 3:43 PM] antonb
It's in the Yellowstone model, compute provider gets rewarded for factual compute. I'm not sure that holding MOR is a strict requirement for running a node.
Maybe everyone will start with 0 balances and the provider will be selected only based on bids for some time.
But yeah, would be good if someone could confirm that.


[1/29/2024 3:44 PM] antonb
There is also the option to buy some on DEX


[1/29/2024 3:44 PM] notmrhuman
Since mor reward for 90 days will be accumulated in a contract then how will they distribute these tokens assuming from 91 day and onward mor will be distributed to node runners based on amount of mor they have burned


[1/29/2024 3:47 PM] antonb
I believe that MOR burn won't be the factor for token distribution.

@SmartAgents 
Gonna share some feedback
1. I'd buy a beer to the dev created this UI üçª , love it
2. Token Contract button doesn't work for me.
3. I can't see my stETH balance (MOR is ok)
4. Capital sections has this description:
> People who provide the intelligence to use the frontends, capital and compute.
which might be confusing for some. Maybe it worth to rephrase.
5. "Current daily reward" reflects the whole daily emissions. I think it will be more informational to indicate emissions dedicated for each category.
6. "Started at" - is it a date of your deposit?
7. Community tab have "Withdraw stETH" button, but Capital tab doesn't. I think it should be the other way around)
8. Coders and Compute tabs have no info and link to Github
9. Would be nice to have social links in the website footer for easier navigation


[1/30/2024 4:21 AM] antonb
10. I'd also add information about yield earned and number of participant, ideally in the form of chart


[1/30/2024 4:22 AM] antonb
And big timer on the top counting down to the end of the bootstrapping period)

You have only one attempt. If you fail, you won't get access NEVER!!! (They will)

Finally got it, you are talking about Bittensor and TAO is their token.
According to this infographics, they are in Computation category, when Morpheus is about front ends and smart contracts.

I believe that someone who is more aware of Bittensor will provide you with extended answer

From Feb 8th you can stake for any time you want. It could be days or years. 90 days it's the bootstrapping period while tokens aren't transferable/claimable.

It depends on the MOR price, which depends on yield, which depends on the stETH provided, which is accurately unpredictable, but you can do your math and come up with a range like  $0,1 - $5

You just can't buy/transfer/claim whatever, for 90 days after launch due to bootstrapping period.

If you read correctly

You stake stETH for 90 days, and you get MOR after 91 days, numbers of MOR depending of how much you stake

Correct. The pool will be established on Arb by pairing 51444 MOR of protection fund emissions for 90 days and earned yield from deposited stETH

üí™  Community is rapidly growing as we approach launch on Feb 8th, which is awesome, but at the same time, the number of scammers also extend.

üì¢  Here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO token allocations
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

Glad to have Erik and many other great contributors. The nice thing about Morpheus is there is no Company, anyone can build without permission.

Interesting concept guys. AI assistants were recently discussed in Vitalik's article as well and he also mentioned how AI assistant inside an open source wallet or any code can have certain dangers like a bad actor optimizing his code consistently to bypass the AI assistant's checking (let's say in case of a scammy signature). Just wanted your perspective if you had a read of his article

It was a good article. I agree with him for the most part. Agree that there are a good emerging set of use cases where chat interfaces can improve user experience when using Smart Contracts. Prerequisite is a personal AI working on your behalf. An open source Smart Agent taking actions approved by your keys. Hence Morpheus : )

We should consider registering a TAO subnet to incentivize agent innovation, and collect TAO + MOR emissions. With a goal to eventually commercialize agent solutions. Just thinking out loud.


[1/31/2024 11:46 AM] momos6210
I have always wondered about this. Why not register a subnet on TAO, which is already designed and built from the ground up for this purpose specifically? Why do everything separately from scratch? Nobody has given me a convincing answer.


[1/31/2024 11:59 AM] smartagents
Open to cool ideas. Great to see NOUS has launched a subnet on TAO. The next version of Morpheus 0.0.6 is defaulting to NOUS Hermes which is one of the best open source models. However the Morpheus platform is itself not focused on training or releasing models, though if people want to leverage cheap Inference via Morpheus to train a model go for it. Instead the objective for Morpheus is to allow anyone who wants to deploy a Smart Agent to have the compute, capital, code and community rails they need to do so.

[1/31/2024 12:00 PM] smartagents
Morpheus is agnostic to the way Compute Providers offer Inference to Coders. If people want to use Akash, Bittensor, Ritual, EdgeLlama or anything else more power to them. If they can collect rewards from those protocols and Morpheus more power to them.


[1/31/2024 12:03 PM] smartagents
The Morpheus community is pulling together all these pieces of Decentralized AI together. A personal AI install, wallet connections, Smart Contract embeddings, Smart Agent Inference, an Agent Marketplace, funding for development (Techno Capital Machine) and so forth.


[1/31/2024 12:18 PM] daochemist
What's the difference between NOUS Hermes and Mistral AI?


[1/31/2024 12:28 PM] smartagents
Both are good Large Language Models, Nous is a fine tuned version thats more powerful. Also Nous is more crypto friendly and part of the Morpheus community. But you can pick any open source model to run for your Morpheus local install.

Hi. Here is the quote from the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 
**What is the minimum requirement to provide Compute?**
> If you are offering a small model only 16 gigs of memory is required. All depends on the LLM you are offering inference for.


[1/31/2024 5:58 PM] antonb
If you just want to explore the process and run a local node, it might work out, but you need more powerful GPU if your goal is providing Compute in the future.

Hello Elonpepe. 
Many useful info are in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs , incl the answer tou your question:

**How can I run the node?** 
You need a Mac or PC with Linux Debian with 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core, this a minimum requirement to ensure that there will be no issue on the system side and run most LLMs, follow steps from the guides located in the readme on Github.

Brief answers is that the Morpheus network pays Providers only for Compute actually provided through a competitive bid process, and also imbues the important metrics of time and a Pass/Fail test, Compute must meet to receive rewards.

yes I've already read that. But on this page - https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md it says: "Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code". So this implies that the review process is centrlised? and therefore that the reviewers, whoever they are, could theoretically game the system in their favour?

Atomic governance has a goal to streamline the process of decision making. All developers make their own choices about which code to Merge and all users can pick and choose any code they want to use, its a free market on both sides.

Maybe because Morpheus is purely community led project and there is no developer yet who would take on this task.

Need to check with @The Oracle


[2/1/2024 8:27 PM] joe_ai
Sorry, still not really getting how the atomic governance system of this project works, based on the link you provided. 

My questions is specifically in relation to how MOR tokens are distributed for valid code submissions, as dictated by the Reviewer on the Github. 

Like I understand that if people want they can fork the project, or just cherry pick which code contributions they want to use but that's the same with any open source project. 

I will rephrase my question: When somebody submits their code contribution, including link to the work and number of hours spent, who determines who the centralised reviewer is that can "approve" the submission and therefore make it eligible to receive MOR tokens?


[2/1/2024 8:43 PM] antonb
AFAIK, the owner of the repo in the person who approves/declines code contributions.

There are also best practices code contribution in place following which gives a significant chance that your contribution will be accepted, here is one of the quotes from there:

> The concept here is NOT based on the Labor Theory of Value. It doesn't matter how many hours are worked but rather the value produced by the work. That's why the repository owner has to actually merge in the code (the product of the work) for it to count toward rewards. The repository owner acts as the "customer" in the marketplace. Look at other contributors to the repo and gauge the needs of the repository owner.

[2/1/2024 8:57 PM] antonb
Does that make sense for you?


[2/1/2024 9:06 PM] joe_ai
Yes it does. So to summarise, the MOR distributions for Code submission/valuation of that code submission is for now centralised given it's administered and controlled by the repo owner. Nothing wrong with that of course, just as long as people are aware that this part at least is a centralised approval process/MOR distribution. 

I'm generally in favour of progressive decentralisation. In the future, I think you could probably replace the approval process for valid code submissions with prediction markets.


[2/1/2024 9:11 PM] joe_ai
My next question is in relation to the capital contributions. 

Are you going to be using a Uniswap Liquidity Pool for the stETH/MOR? And if so, which entity if not a DAO controlled by MOR token holders, will control the MOR tokens initially added as liquidity to this pool?  

And which entity/individual/multisig will have control of the contract that collects the 3.4% on stETH deposists (current LIDO yield on stETH)?


[2/1/2024 9:21 PM] antonb
There will be initial pool on Arb Uniswap so the pair is wstETH/MOR. There is no entity to be controlled, at least I didn't hear any mentions of it.
MOR for the initial liquidity will be taken from the Protection Fund emissions equal 51,444 MOR by day 90 and paired after with stETH yield gained during bootstrapping period.

Capital Contract is going to be secured by multisig

Is that 16 GB of VRAM a hard requirement to able to install Morpheus on a Mac? Or is that only required for certain functions to work such as providing computing resources to other users?

Entirely decentralized systems or DAOs are incredibly slow, require a token or some other kind of metric, so for a project just starting out it makes sense for the repo owner to approve if there a verifiable contributions :sadgepray:

I prefer Atomic Governance over DAOs, I find the later are often corrupt and hard to incentivize voting

I hear you, DAOs are tough and not generally well suited to teams that want to move fast. sub-DAOs can be structured that way though with high degrees of autonomy. So as a governance design, I think it would make sense to have a protocol DAO for the things you want slow governance for by design, and then Sub-DAOs for everything else. What concerns me atm is that there is a multisig (I don‚Äôt know who is on it) that can basically decide who gets paid MOR for Code submissions  and who doesn‚Äôt.

Agreed. TCM individual decisions over DAOs crowd decisions. DAOs can make sense with narrow application and for mature product that already has "product / market fit" protocols such as Uniswap.
Sub-DAOs or I like Holacracy for small teams doing faster paced early development.
Yes, that's the best that has been come up with for Code rewards.
It would be great to see this type of thing to be automated in the future.
I'm a fan of TEA protocol for tracing dependencies in code and rewarding them.
If someone feels the Code rewards don't make sense they can fork the code and start another implementation, however that takes a lot of work. And thus far every code commit is linked to real code work so its pretty transparent.

Ethereum did the same thing in the early days. And is one of the reasons I think it was so successful was the reward to a broad set of developers who contributed before the genesis block. Rewards to only Compute or only Capital tend to naturally only attract those with Capital or Compute. Devs go where they are fairly rewarded.

Some individuals need to have control over the multisig in the beginning. There‚Äôs quite literally no other way to execute. 

Smart agents lays it out well.

DAOs will significantly hinder development speed and efficiency for growth companies/products. DAOs should be implemented in mature products that will foresee undergoing minimal structural/functional change.

But who determines which individuals are on this multisig? What if they don‚Äôt sign? What if the person determining a fair amount of hours for code contributors becomes corrupt? Are there public multisig signer rules for the signers to comply with? and what would be the process to move away from this multisig in the future when the time is right? Because that‚Äôs 24% of the MOR distribution which is basically gonna be in the hands of a multisig for which there is very little governance visibility.


[2/2/2024 4:15 AM] joe_ai
I believe both oSNAP by UMA and Safe/Zodiac have multisig solutions that can help mitigate some of these risks.

I‚Äôm not saying the multisig should be in place forever as an FYI. It‚Äôs a starting point to kickstart the project and bootstrap.


[2/2/2024 4:23 AM] joe_ai
I get that. Just think there should be control mechanisms in place to replace it in the future. Otherwise it‚Äôs just relying on the goodwill of the multisig holders to agree to give up control of 25% of the MOR distribution in the future - which they may be unwilling to do, especially if the market cap becomes significant. Anyways, just my 2 cents and flagging what I view as a material governance risk.

This makes sense for the future. Again it's open-source, if things are to move fast you either trust the multisig holders or you don't. Otherwise fork the code and run distribute your own tokens under the governance you wish to employ :sadgepray: nothing will stop you from taking this path

Yes, some may choose the Hard Fork route. Though there is another way too. As the goal of the Morpheus community is always to move toward ‚Äúatomic governance‚Äù everyone looks forward to multiple implementations of every aspect of the Morpheus code base from Smart Contracts to Node software; this is welcomed and encouraged. The 24% MOR emissions for Coders will include these multiple implementations pro-rata to their popularity / usage by the community. Presuming they honor the same tokenomics and fair launch ownership records of the Morpheus community. 

Ethereum today has many clients. That is healthy, though it takes time to get to that point. Still a lot of work to do by developers on the fronts of Compute (the Decentralized Router), Community Front Ends and many improvements to the Smart Contracts and Node are needed. After that point it would be great to see devs start the work to creating multiple implementations.

Hi, may I know who is the  the "sponsor" referred to here and how he/she selected Renascence vs the other ~50 auditors?


[2/2/2024 9:22 PM] mosh4511
Hello good sers. on behalf of a venture capital firm based in the Netherlands I am very interested in discussing the possibilities of making a contribution in the funding phase of this project. Is there somebody from core team I could speak with about the possibilities?


[2/2/2024 9:23 PM] undercoverser
I'm aware there has been community audits, Renascence audit, and an ongoing Codehawks bug-finding competition. Just want to ensure a successful launch as this will be a massive honeypot esp during the first 90 days and might make or break the project.


[2/2/2024 9:44 PM] smartagents
You would have to ask them. But from what I know it was the level of experience of the auditors.


[2/2/2024 9:45 PM] smartagents
Agreed. The more testing the better.


[2/2/2024 10:05 PM] antonb
Hey Mosh. You are able to contribute stETH to the Morpheus as Capital Provider and being rewarded with MOR tokens. 
This is the only way you can convert money to token.

There is no team, no founders, no premine, allocations, whitelists and etc, but fair launch.

whats the best way to get a big picture of whats being built right now / whos building / which products and services etc? I am doing DD for a team that knows how to build LLM's but has no experience with crypto whatsoever and would like to understand where they could fit in.


[2/3/2024 12:43 AM] infiniteatman
also @SmartAgents I still didnt fully understand how rewards are accrued for contributions. Are they eventually tied to traffic? So top down Front ends funnel traffic to models and capacity and everyone benefits via traffic and use? Otherwise I dont really understand how contribution can be objectively evaluated, since any repository lead could just merge their own contributions which are unfairly valued? basically will products / frontends and contributions need to be used to benefit from MOR inflation?

[2/3/2024 1:08 AM] smartagents
Yes. The rewrads for the Front Ends are determined by "traffic" as in on chain activity. There is a Waterloo paper in draft working to describe this is more detail. Compare it to the App Store. Apps are rewarded based on downloads, people who pay for the app or buy things in the app. Same thing here just no 30% taken from Apple. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uMvRT_WA1KqJAkoHbs7fxDkMtYrcdprXrbOmssEXtGg/edit?usp=sharing

[2/3/2024 3:56 AM] infiniteatman
If we stick to the app analogy the rewards should basically trickle down from there right? In our case whoever is contributing code / compute to the apps that are used are getting rewards proportionally to their use? This way the only way to game the system is by fake traffic which since paid through in MOR is not economically viable. Did I capture it correctly here?


[2/3/2024 3:56 AM] smartagents
Correct. That's the idea.


[2/3/2024 3:56 AM] infiniteatman
I wondered about this, but from what I gather the market I.e the user / customer defines the rewards flow


[2/3/2024 3:57 AM] smartagents
Yep.


[2/3/2024 3:57 AM] infiniteatman
However since there will be very few users in the beginning and inflation is fixed how does this work?


[2/3/2024 3:57 AM] infiniteatman
It would require more mor paid for services then inflation paid out to work

Hi devs im curious abt 1 thing, solely providing rewards and a platform for developers to build on doesnt seems to be enough. How do u plan to onboard more developers? Will you guys be marketing? Or follow TAO footstep by actively seeking out more members? @antonb | will not DM you

[2/3/2024 8:55 PM] antonb
My personal perspective is that Morpheus will easily get attention with its values and solely community owned approach. Which is the biggest attractor. iMO. 
Anyone can get onboard itself, if he wants and become a part of Morpheus.


[2/3/2024 8:58 PM] singledigitmonster
Hm interesting. In that case my perspective as to how morpheus will gain traction is through word of mouth from developers to developers over time?


[2/3/2024 9:42 PM] antonb
Generally, yes, organic marketing, just like Bitcoin did. 
But there are some other ways, for instance:
- In the #üóûÔ∏±morpheus-news you can find really thought-provoking podcasts with David which greatly contribute to awareness about Morpheus.
- through partnerships with DeAI ecosystem players
- through events. Huge one will held during Denver ETH
- MOR token price appreciation will also have impact
- through interest from software development companies, I already know several that are willing to devote their resources to build apps/tools
- through the increasingly growing interest in the DeAI industry. Take at least Vitalik‚Äôs latest article
- and of course, interest will grow as smart agents enter the market, which are designed to radically change the way users interact with WEB3

Hi guys, some questions I have:
1) Now a personal acting defi agent is developed? What future applications are expected/being worked on?
2) I what way can we see Morpheus complementary to Bittensor and Akash? At the first glance they seem to be competitors...


[2/4/2024 5:26 AM] smartagents
1. Morpheus is Agent agnostic. A developer can deploy anything they want. A user can opt to use any agent they want, its a free market. It certainly will be exciting to see what people deploy when users have a powerful LLM at their finger tips, that can connect to Smart Contracts and be authorized by their Wallet.


[2/4/2024 5:27 AM] smartagents
2. Morpheus is Compute agnostic. Akash, Bittensor, EdgeLlama, Ritual, use any Distributed Compute system you want to offer Compute for Smart Agents, LLMs, Diffusion models, and get rewarded from Morpheus.


[2/4/2024 5:28 AM] smartagents
I'd sum it up as. 
Ethereum is a platform for Smart Contracts.
Morpheus is a platform for Smart Agents.


[2/4/2024 5:28 AM] smartagents
To get there you have to plug in Code, Capital, Compute and Community (front ends). Check out the TCM paper it says it well.

So web2 agents are possible I guess?


[2/4/2024 5:37 AM] smartagents
Perhaps. How would you describe a Web2 "agent"?
I'm using the Smart Agent definition from this paper.
Sort of requires a Web3 wallet for users to authorize actions, paid agents, take on chain actions.
And on the dev side its hard to reward an agent without a public address.

For example an Open source chatgpt...? But in this example where do I need the Morpheus Network for?


[2/4/2024 6:57 AM] smartagents
If you want to run local Inference of text models go right ahead. The Network comes in handy when you need Compute beyond what you have locally available. Say you want to make an image or Video and need GPUs. That's where a lot of Decentralized Compute might come in handy.


[2/4/2024 6:58 AM] smartagents
Or if you wanted to focus on your Code and deploy your Smart Agent or GPT fine tuned model and make it discoverable by the Morpheus community you could Register your Smart Agent and get included in the Smart Agent embeddings to be called when a user's Smart Agent proposes an action that uses your specialized Smart Agent.


[2/4/2024 7:00 AM] smartagents
Same as always really. The original reason for the Internet was to share Academic papers / data between Universities they didn't create or have space to store locally. In modern times devs publish their applications to the Play or App Store for Discoverability and to handle payments without having to deploy their own infrastructure.


[2/4/2024 7:15 AM] smartagents
In short Morpheus is useful if you need:
- A Chat Interface with a built in GUI.
- Access to a wide set of open source LLMs.
- Payment rails for Inference.
- Large Scale Decentralized Compute.
- Integrated Front Ends.
- Capital for your app development.
- Discoverability of your application.
- Audits of your Smart Agent.
- Tracking of rewards for open source contributions.
- Built in Intent detection to trigger other agentic actions.
- Proof of user intent and a proof of their action approval. 
- On chain persistent history of actions.
- Persistent storage of a user's Smart Agent context & history.
- Persistent storage of a users connections to other Agents.
- A wallet for a Smart Agent to get paid or pay other agents.
- The ability to move between devices.
- The ability to deploy or use agents jurisdiction agnostically.
- The ability to access uncensored data permissionlessly.

As I said it's being developed now and everything will be settled closer to the launch, but my guess is that MOR is going to be a key.

I anticipate that the vast majority of MOR compute consumers will be user apps and agents, and that end users will be provided with a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards.

Hi, so I noticed that Morpheus uses LayerZero for cross-chain messaging and transfers. I have to ask, given that LayerZero uses Google cloud for oracles (which isnt very decentralized), what are the risks for staked stETH in morpheus smart contract if LayerZero gets hacked? Can it put in danger locked stETH on ethereum? Are there any plans to incorporate maybe CCIP for cross chain (I know they are not in mainnet yet)?


[2/5/2024 2:02 PM] antonb
Hi basado. That needs to be confirmed, but from my understanding of the contract functionality, L0 bridge will have access only to that part of yield (not stETH principal) for which the contract administrator gives it permission before transaction.

[2/5/2024 4:57 PM] 0xzohan
ty for the response. 

I have concerns regarding the entity that operates the Router (if it is singular at launch). If this entity is capable of functioning simultaneously as a Router owner, User, and Compute Provider, what safeguards are in place to prevent them from manipulating the system for their own gain? Specifically, is there anything that would prevent the Router owner from falsely categorising a User's computational request as requiring Inferred Frames per Second (IFPS), which is typically more computationally intensive and thus more lucrative in terms of MOR tokens, when the actual task involves Language processing (TPS), which is less demanding? Such a misrepresentation could allow the Router owner to undercut market bids and secure the compute task at a lower cost, exploiting the system to receive a disproportionate amount of MOR. How does Morpheus‚Äôs design address these potential conflicts of interest and ensure that all participants are acting with integrity?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[2/5/2024 6:22 PM] 0xzohan
Additionally, what is the incentive mechanism to stop Users stating a returned response was a Fail?

There is an incentive for the Compute provider to return a Pass, but what is the incentive for the user to say the response was a pass/fail?


[2/5/2024 6:24 PM] antonb
Great points which will be addressed as soon as someone close to Compute and Router development comes online.

[2/5/2024 7:26 PM] 0xzohan
Another Q to add to this list (apologies in advance haha) -
If a dev creates a useful Agent on Morpheus (and it's on the Morphesus App Store / Agent Store) then what is the reason a dev would create a token around that agent? Users stake their stETH to give up yield to provide liquidity to the token + they receive the token for doing so - but what is the point of the token? In MORs case it's to provide the inference/compute layer - but why does an Agent App need to launch a token?

No limitations, no KYC, whitelists or whatever, just fair launch.

Is morpheous creating new net AI? Meaning will MOR create its own LLM or will they use zuck‚Äôs and integrate it into their own system?

[2/5/2024 10:41 PM] antonb
Feb 8th is the launch of Phase 1. Capital and Code


[2/5/2024 10:41 PM] itzhendrx
and token release will on after 90 days right?


[2/5/2024 10:41 PM] itzhendrx

As Compute contract aren't live yet, emissions are stored is the distribution contract and will be utilized after compute launch.

Quick clarification: are folks going to stake/deposit stETH and just earn MOR or is it giving up your stETH without the ability to retrieve it after?


[2/6/2024 3:21 AM] defi_dad
Looks like we just deposit stETH and then you get it back -- true farming. You can withdraw all your principal later?


[2/6/2024 3:24 AM] antonb
Yeah, you will be able to withdraw any moment after initial 7 days lock-up

Agreed. The archectures seem to be leaning toward starting with a Decentralized Router.


[2/6/2024 4:26 AM] smartagents
I don't think all Agents will need a token. Depends on how its structured. They may just want MOR tokens as payment or stablecoins.

Hey there,

I just found MorpheusAI and it seems quite cool. I saw that the fairlunch is planned 8th of this month but I did not found more information. Is there an article or something that I can read on how can I participate on the fairlunch?


[2/6/2024 5:08 AM] enurasem
is morpheus similar to balance dao?


[2/6/2024 5:20 AM] dl_76366
Where could we buy MOR during the fairlaunch? Will it be on Ethereum network or Arbitrum?


[2/6/2024 5:23 AM] infiniteatman
I wondered if there was a discussion around how the pool / token will be launched after the 90 days of staking. If its a simple uniswap pool and the contract is known before hand, it will most likely be sniped hard, right? Running an LBP would most likely create a fairer price discovery for all participants?


[2/6/2024 5:30 AM] smartagents
Uniswap pool.
The way "sniping" is avoided is to have the Protection Fund unlock its MOR first (before anyone else) and then start the pool. Then the next day everyone else unlocks.


[2/6/2024 5:30 AM] smartagents
You can not buy MOR during the first 90 days (known as the boot strapping period).


[2/6/2024 5:30 AM] smartagents
There is an article on the fair launch also more info on Github.

High chances. Here is the quote from the last announcement:

> Next step is for the Public Audit judging to complete tomorrow and for the devs to determine if any last issues need to be addressed before the fair launch. This will tell us if February 8th is the deployment date.

Can projects launch a native token? In the TCM docs it says this - "Using TCM, the developer deploys a native token to power their project." - is this refering to Morphesus explicitly? I.e. Projects (Agent App) launched on Morphesus' TCM can also launch their own native token? Or is it saying that if a project launches its own TCM based on the TCM framework then in that case it'd have the it's native token rather than MOR?

Does this mean a developer launching their own project (Agent App etc.) can launch a native token?


[2/7/2024 12:32 AM] smartagents
I think we will see both. Some devs will launch a token using the TCM framework via a fork of the Morpheus Smart Contracts. You will also likely see interfaces where people extend the Morpheus contracts to direct yield token boot strapping new projects directly on Morpheus. I like that Agent App or Smart Agent term.

Ty for getting back to me - but to be clear the TCM docs in the github specifically refer to the framework that Morpheus is built on, and when it says ‚ÄúUsing TCM, the developer deploys a native token to power their project‚Äù they‚Äôre referring to MOR - and not that there may one day be an extension of that framework in which projects launch a native token?

[2/7/2024 2:17 AM] antonb
Everything is in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**What are the risks of providing capital?**
There are always risks with smart contracts like bugs or vulnerabilities. To ensure a high level of security, the contracts have undergone multiple levels of audits, including community audit, cybersecurity company audit, as well as a public bug bounty campaign. Security reports are publicly available on GitHub. That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

ah nice, so just for the sake of simplicity - 1 stEth ~ 1 MOR, correct ?


[2/7/2024 3:01 AM] smartagents
No.


[2/7/2024 3:01 AM] smartagents
Its a competition.


[2/7/2024 3:01 AM] smartagents
So it depends on the number of stETH that are provided by Capital Providers.


[2/7/2024 3:02 AM] smartagents
So the number of MOR each day emitted is known, but the number of stETH provided is dynamic.


[2/7/2024 3:02 AM] smartagents
I'm sure the market will figure it out. Will be interesting to see how many stETH are provided to earn the MOR.


[2/7/2024 3:03 AM] utop94
so its the % of the total pool ? the more % one has in the pool more his rewards ?

{Reactions}

[2/7/2024 3:03 AM] smartagents
Correct.


[2/7/2024 3:04 AM] utop94
so imagine if someone has 50% of the pool liquidity and the MOR are emitted ~ 3456/daily ---> So that person will get 3456/2 MOR


[2/7/2024 3:05 AM] utop94
correct ?


[2/7/2024 3:09 AM] justforfun6010
the staking will be on ethereum only or also some other chains?


[2/7/2024 3:58 AM] smartagents
In this case "Pool" means all the people providing stETH that same day. Then yes. Though the emissions rate decines every day for 16 years, so not exactly 3,456 after the firs day, but generally yes. See th Whitepaper for the details.

Morning everyone! Are you ready for the fair launch?


[2/7/2024 1:20 PM] mr.heffernan
Good morning everyone, So the launch will start on February 8th and how can you buy the token/coin?


[2/7/2024 1:28 PM] antonb
Yep, Feb 8th, 12:00 pm UTC. You can't buy, but earn, contributing capital in form of the stETH and be rewarded in MOR token proportionally to your contribution.
All the details are here #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

Is steth the only asset you can contribute with


[2/7/2024 2:10 PM] antonb
Yes, stETH is the only asset


[2/7/2024 2:11 PM] antonb
In the future it might be expanded to multicurrency bucket to maximize yield, but for the beginning it's stETH.


[2/7/2024 2:12 PM] alias9272
How long will we have to contribute steth once the smart contract is deployed on the 8th?


[2/7/2024 2:13 PM] alias9272
Are contributions closed at some point or not?

I reckon that you mean Smart Agents, right? Actually  good question, as there will be many  of them and Morpheus is permissionless, you would be able to find one that fulfills your requirements.

stETH on Ethereum mainnet.

wstETH it's the wrapped version of the stETH on Arbitrum.
But deposit will be on the ETH mainnet in stETH, when MOR claims (after 90 days) on Arbitrum.

It's pro rata to your stETH contribution against total pool amount.


[2/7/2024 6:12 PM] antonb
For example, if there are 100 Capital Providers who each contributed 1 stETH on day 1 when the network launches, and total pool equals 100stETH, then each one gets 1% of the 3,456 MOR tokens this day = 34.56 MOR.

It's up to your strategy, you might want to accept risk and be among first to get more rewards as the competition is low or you risk averse person and prefer to wait some time before deposit.

It's in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**What are the risks of providing capital?**
There are always risks with smart contracts like bugs or vulnerabilities. To ensure a high level of security, the contracts have undergone multiple levels of audits, including community audit, cybersecurity company audit, as well as a public bug bounty campaign. Security reports are publicly available on GitHub. That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

looks like 5 out of 6 High Priority bugs are in code used by Mocks for testing only
mocks are NEVER used on mainnet
the only concern i have is that CodeHawks audited this code and marked it high priority, unless they were worried that this code might find it's way to mainnet accidentally

Thanks @antonb | will not DM you ....is there a channel for node running and ask questions?


[2/7/2024 8:58 PM] antonb
If you are going to provide Compute, the best place is #üõ†Ô∏±community-apps-builders. If general tech support, then #üö®Ô∏±tech-support


[2/7/2024 8:58 PM] smartagents
Looks pretty typical for a Smart Contract report. The bug finders are incentivized to describe the bugs in worse case scenarios. Though perhaps its worth noting the auditors came back afterwards and said these Smart Contracts we actually very tight and hard to find bugs in due to the audits that had already taken place.

What is compute...absolute noob here. Can understand till running node but didnt understand compute. TIA


[2/7/2024 9:05 PM] antonb
Compute = computation resources for AI. May I know a reason you wanna run a node?


[2/7/2024 9:08 PM] rbk256
I started running nodes lately like Mintlayer, shardeum . I am trying to learn and understand crypto indepth and explore . i used to do only buying and selling crypto now i am exploring running nodes


[2/7/2024 9:08 PM] rbk256
Can we run this node in ubuntu VPS servers?


[2/7/2024 9:09 PM] rbk256
or cent os?


[2/7/2024 9:10 PM] antonb
Could I ask your to check the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs ? It covers most of the common questions about nodes

**Can I run the node on VPS?**
You can not run one at the moment as there is no version of the node that can operate without a GUI yet.

Just waking up. I'm David Johnston. I've been public about my open source contributions to Morpheus.


[2/7/2024 9:13 PM] smartagents
This is the correct take. Finding issues in the mock contract isn't related to the Smart Contracts on mainnet. Likely the mock's should have been excluded from the bug audit rewards, but they were in the same Smart Contract repo so testers pointed out those bugs too.

Correct. And this is how the testers felt about the code quality.

EigenLayer addressed a security incident reported by a number of restakers this week where users were tricked into signing transactions that queued withdrawals and drained funds from stakers' wallets. They shared a critical update from Blockaid on Twitter highlighting the severity of the incident - could be worth the team reviewing to be familiar with this targeting of stakers https://twitter.com/eigenlayer/status/1752863699830731063?s=46

üí™  Community is rapidly growing as we approach launch on Feb 8th, which is awesome, but at the same time, the number of scammers also extend.

üì¢  Here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO token allocations
‚ùå NO NFT sales
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

There are three main factors:

- time while your stETH in the pool

you can delete this question after reading @antonb | will not DM you xD

You can do this because the only thing that matters is the amount of stETH you deposited.

with this strategy can i make more mor?

or it wont matter?


[2/8/2024 12:36 AM] antonb
It doesn't matter. Lets imagine you have 10 ETH you want to deposit. You can do this from one wallet or 5 wallets per 2 ETH each or 10 wallets per 1 ETH each, outcome will be the same.


[2/8/2024 12:50 AM] levooo111

Fair launch for Morpheus starts tomorrow (February 8th) 12 pm UTC. 
The only valid multisig address is: MOR.ETH = 0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E

RECOMMEND everyone uses the Dashboard Interface to contribute stETH. Do not send stETH to the Smart Contract address or try and structure a transaction manually.

There is no NFT
There is no token sale
There is no airdrop

Only way to earn MOR tokens is by contributing stETH yield https://app.ens.domains/mor.eth

Hello frens,
To understand better tomorrow at 12 : 
- stake Steth at https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital
- Steth will be locked 7 days then can be withdrawn.
- In the meantime, half will be converted to tokens and half added to liquidity
- IF you stake for 90 days you get max amount of rewards (depending of size always)
- Then listing on ARB with liquidity and distribution

It will be locked for 7 days, the longer you keep it in the more MOR rewards you earn

ok is the token already live or set to launch tmr or TGE will be after the claim?

Token won't be live i.e. claimable/sendable/tradable until bootstrapping period ends and AMM pool set. (~May 9th)

we contribute on mainnet or arb

my answer , thanks


[2/8/2024 3:01 AM] smartagents
16 years for the first epoch.


[2/8/2024 3:02 AM] smartagents
3,456 MOR rewarded per day then declines to 0 at year 16.


[2/8/2024 3:02 AM] mayos.
question why would morpheus decide to launch their token on arb instead of mainnet


[2/8/2024 3:02 AM] smartagents
Cheaper fees for sending tokens. Important for the utility of using MOR for AI Inference payments.

but there is issue about indiviuals who can contribute  big amounts, for a capital providers is there any whale protect mechanism?
when i stake 1-2 eth in the pool of whales, big vc etc. how can i able to get a enough percentage of token


[2/8/2024 3:24 AM] mahalleinirx
Plans are to have them ready by time bootstrapping ends, May 9th


[2/8/2024 3:24 AM] mahalleinirx
there is no cap, as people will sybil, outlined in the FAQ


[2/8/2024 3:26 AM] mahalleinirx
There are other ways to contribute


[2/8/2024 3:27 AM] noir99999
so bootstraping period is only for staker?


[2/8/2024 3:27 AM] mahalleinirx
However as you do not lose your stETH the tokens generated will be vs the yield you would generate holding stETH


[2/8/2024 3:28 AM] mahalleinirx
Code and Capital

It‚Äôs not pointing at mainnet until tomorrow


[2/8/2024 3:34 AM] smartagents
To be clear. As it states in the Whitepaper the yield becomes part of the Protocol Owned Liquity and Capital Contributors get MOR tokens. So while you can withdraw your original stETH you can not withdraw the stETH yield (rebase rewards) those stay in the Protocol to provide liquidity.

Im still learning about frames on farcaster and what they can be used for besides NFT mints. If anyone has any ideas on how we could use Frames to help grow the Morpheus community and make it even more awesome, do share üôå


[2/8/2024 6:43 AM] freeman8008
We could create a frame that takes a snapshot of the dashboard stats every day


[2/8/2024 6:43 AM] freeman8008
Then a button in the frame that goes to the dashboard


[2/8/2024 6:48 AM] joe_ai
Love it. If you or somebody else knows how/has the bandwidth to build it, that would be an awesome contribution.

Is there any reason why the SNX staking contract wasn't used or inherited from?

This should be easy to do, I‚Äôll work on this tomorrow

Just to get thing right: I understand well that the window to deposit is a 90 days period, it's not only today?

Frens, when you stake your Steth, do you still own them or it will be kept by the staking contract ?


[2/8/2024 7:25 AM] genesis70707
Feeling shaky putting big amount if not owned, most will feel same


[2/8/2024 7:27 AM] smartagents
You can withdraw stETH anytime you want (after the first 7 days from deposit).
Only the stETH yield (rebase rewards) become part of the Protocol Owned Liquidity.


[2/8/2024 7:27 AM] pravus_
Hi @SmartAgents, is there any way i can contribute compute to the project?


[2/8/2024 7:28 AM] lemonflex
@SmartAgents so stETH will be kept in the multi-sig during the first 90 days?


[2/8/2024 7:37 AM] genesis70707
You would get so much more stETH allocated if people would not have to stake them in the contract, not sure if technically possible tough


[2/8/2024 7:40 AM] woody_the_degen
Is there Morpheus explantation for dummies?


[2/8/2024 7:45 AM] smartagents
That comes in Phase 2. Likely 90 days away.


[2/8/2024 7:45 AM] smartagents
You can leave stETH in the Capital Provider Smart Contract as long as you like. Day 90 you can claim the MOR tokens.


[2/8/2024 7:45 AM] thade
you‚Äôll be able to deposit even after 90 days. the 90 days is just for Morpheus to bootstrap liquidity. you can still provide capital after 90 days and earn MOR

Looked at ways to do that. None were technically available. Would to do that with Thorchain for example but the yield there only goes to 1 address, you can't direct the yield the way you can with Lido stETH.

Hey guys, Im actually a senior smart contract dev. And I took a look to the audits, and tbh it looks a bit weird. Can you explain the audits? Why are the mocs included?


[2/8/2024 7:56 AM] smartagents
The Mock mostly likely should not have been included in the audit. But they were in the same repository so the bug bounty hunters included a bunch of notes on that too.


[2/8/2024 7:57 AM] smartagents
There was a dedicated Private audit too if you want a more traditional report.

You can swap on 1inch, or deposit directly on Lido

It is actually free to swap ETH to stETH on 1inch?

I see also, is wstETH usable? Or it has to be exclusively stETH


[2/8/2024 8:36 AM] blade2c_
Is there an actual minimum required to provide to the pool tomorrow?


[2/8/2024 8:37 AM] mahalleinirx
0.01


[2/8/2024 8:39 AM] blade2c_
Oh thats fair enough, and is there a limit also on the amount of liquidity that can be provided, or it un limited?

Sorry, Just let me correct, i dont mean as an individual adress, I mean everyone

for the fair launch, do stETH deposits share pro-rata 24% of new MOR or they get more?

then who decides how to distribute the other 24%s among community coders and compute?

Hello. There is an explanation in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 
Liquidity will be added after the bootstrapping period (90 days)

**How will the initial liquidity be created? **
51,444 MOR tokens by day 90 dedicated to the protection fund and leveraged for bootstrapping purpose will be paired with yield generated from deposited stETH and put into AMM liquidity pool.

how long do we have time to deposit stETH ?


[2/8/2024 3:34 PM] smartagents
As long as you want but at least 7 days (to avoid people gaming it and withdrawing before any meaningful yield is contributed). MOR emissions for Capital Providers go for 16 years in the first epoch.

üì¢ As some fellas reported scam attempts recently,  here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

Will there be a time limit for stETH deposits? or at any time I can deposit stETH into the network


[2/8/2024 4:04 PM] higherorderbit
are the stETH contributions on mainnet? or wstETH on Arbitrum?

when is the latest you deposit your stETH? is there no cutoff time?


[2/8/2024 4:20 PM] antonb
The will be website you could connect to with your wallet and deposit


[2/8/2024 4:20 PM] antonb
Don't send stETH to the address directly


[2/8/2024 4:20 PM] 0xgoldrushmagnus.
so like if someone adds their stETH in 20 days from now. can they still get tokens?


[2/8/2024 4:20 PM] degen_skull
Like staking!!!


[2/8/2024 4:21 PM] antonb
No cutoff time, any moment during the first 16 years epoch of the Capital Providers emissions, but only after official launch

[2/8/2024 4:38 PM] max180y
What's the vesting for $mor on tge?


[2/8/2024 4:47 PM] notmrhuman
@Erik Voorhees you guys could have limited the max capital like eigenlayer instead of making it no cap, this staking event will be a whales event


[2/8/2024 4:48 PM] rage4lyf00
++


[2/8/2024 5:05 PM] max180y
Or have a vesting schedule so earned tokens can't be dumped all at once. Helps mitigate the whale problem (but not solve it completely).


[2/8/2024 5:13 PM] antonb
:Rocket:


[2/8/2024 5:14 PM] antonb
You can't stake yet. Fair launch is open for everyone and this is why it's "fair"


[2/8/2024 5:15 PM] woody_the_degen
`so no cap at all?


[2/8/2024 5:15 PM] antonb
Fair launch means equal conditions for everyone. Your advantage is being early here


[2/8/2024 5:17 PM] dadefuga
I meant can i deposit steth already to farm MOR tokens ? (I know it only goes live in 90 says or so)


[2/8/2024 5:17 PM] antonb
From my experience the worst dumps are from teams' cashouts and investors token unlocks. None of them is the case with Morpheus.


[2/8/2024 5:18 PM] antonb
You can't. Kindly wait for the announcement.

[2/8/2024 5:18 PM] dadefuga
So no VC play here ? Because there is a lot of whales already giving steth liquidity. Truly just asking


[2/8/2024 5:20 PM] antonb
No VC, no presales, no whitelists or hidden allocations. More stETH staked means more liquidity and larger buy pressure after the bootstrapping period.
Morpheus tokenomics isn't ordinary.

[2/8/2024 5:23 PM] joe_ai
To be fair, this will largely depend on how much MOR the multisig awards to  individuals for their "Code Contributions". If there are large distributions that go to certain individuals, that could result in material dumping. It probably would have made sense to put at least part of these MOR distributions on a vesting schedule. Not too late for that I guess.


[2/8/2024 5:25 PM] joe_ai
is anyone working on a Dune analytics dashboard for Morpheus?

[2/8/2024 5:28 PM] antonb
I'll wait for it, to load my bags))
Also, keep noting that the only way to VCs to get a substantial amount of tokens is to buy from the market or provide massive amounts of stETH, bot h results I'm MOR token price appreciation

It would be awesome to have one, but some data will be available on the dashboard

yeah are we able to stake stETH from our wallet on the ethereum chain? or do we have to move funds to arbitrum?

in 1 hour right?


[2/8/2024 5:47 PM] smartagents
1. The "Staking event" goes for 16 years.
2. Erik didn't program the smart contracts (that was set of open source devs).
3. The community is sticking to the white paper framework proposed by the anons.
With that said lots of ways to improve and create more ways for people to add yield over time.

Apologies for the questions! So on day 91 and onwards, the only way to get $mor (assuming you're not going to be a community/compute/code provider) is to either deposit stEth as a capital provider or buy $mor from the open market on day 91? And the liquidity for the open market is being provided entirely from stEth deposits right? In essence, a capital provider is a liquidity provider?


[2/8/2024 5:50 PM] ricdoc
can we deposit stETH on arbitrum or only eth chain?


[2/8/2024 5:50 PM] kanamil
only ethereum i think


[2/8/2024 5:50 PM] ricdoc
thank you


[2/8/2024 5:54 PM] antonb
**How will the initial liquidity be created? **
51,444 MOR tokens by day 90 dedicated to the protection fund and leveraged for bootstrapping purpose will be paired with yield generated from deposited stETH and put into AMM liquidity pool.


[2/8/2024 5:54 PM] samwatanabe.
so we need stETH on Arbitrum?


[2/8/2024 5:54 PM] antonb
Yes, the way to obtain MOR if you are not community/code/compute is through capital or buy from the market


[2/8/2024 5:55 PM] antonb
stETH on Ethereum mainnet

[2/8/2024 5:59 PM] max180y
So really, the question to answer is, will the value of earned $mor end up being worth more than the value of the rewards we give up from stEth... Welcome to crypto! Life would be boring without a little gamble every now and then! üòÇ

[2/8/2024 6:17 PM] max180y
You could buy $Kas now and be a insignificant compared to the whales but if price appreciates you're going to be happy. With $mor, you're essentially aiming to accumulate as many tokens as you can in the next 90 days and hope their value is more than the stEth rewards you've sacrificed. After that, you are essentially hoping the project is a success - if it is, you'll personally earn significantly more than stEth rewards - it's all relative to you.

[2/8/2024 6:31 PM] cjfromc4
depositing now vs 5hours later is same, as long as rebase has not happened


[2/8/2024 6:31 PM] bard.eth
I get a warning in Metamask that the deposit pool is 'a deceptive request' as the contract is unverified


[2/8/2024 6:31 PM] ricdoc
thanks - and any multiplier for longer time?  e.g. does 2 days deposited get twice as much as 1 day deposited, or is it based on total stETH staked each day or any other multiplier?  thanks for answering my questions man, you're the best


[2/8/2024 6:31 PM] cjfromc4
no


[2/8/2024 6:31 PM] cjfromc4
based on total stETH staked and your portion of it DURING the rebase


[2/8/2024 6:32 PM] cjfromc4
1 day 2 day 3 day later is all the same as long as its before the rebase


[2/8/2024 6:32 PM] rorschach5534
what is the time for the launch of staking?


[2/8/2024 6:32 PM] cjfromc4
go find out yourself


[2/8/2024 6:33 PM] foxwzrd
hey btw: all the best with the launch, team. A lot of work to get to this point. I know the discord will be flooded but: well done on getting to this point!

Happy Morpheus Fair Launch Day  - Decentralized AI Is Here

It is with great honor that today this community is extending the Independence of Cyberspace to the realm of Intelligence. Let these Smart Agents accelerate and decentralize prosperity across the world over for all people.

There are some great community websites that give the details on the Fair Launch:
1. https://mor.org/fair-launch by @Erik Voorhees 
2. https://medium.com/@oracle_61071/morpheus-mor-launch-tl-dr-4121bd4c3295 by @The Oracle 
3. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/5.FairLaunch.md

**Tl;dr**
- You can now provide stETH (minimum of 0.011). The Smart Contracts are already live on Mainnet.
- However MOR rewards only start calculating at 12 p.m. UTC February 8th 2024, about 18 minutes from now.
- Please do NOT send stETH directly to the Multisig address (this will not generate any MOR rewards). 
- Use the Dashboard Interface to make depositing stETH in the Smart Contract simple.
- The Dashboard is currently being switched from testnet to mainnet. 

The current Dashboard link is: https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital 
The website url may change as it goes to MOR.ETH
Step 1 is the "Approve" Transaction.
The high cap approval is expected behavior so you can do multiple deposits in the future.
Step 2 is the "Deposit" Transaction Action (2 transactions total have to be confirmed via Meta Mask) 
Push "Deposit stETH" both times in the Dashboard.

For advanced users, follow one of the community guides via a block explorer (such as Ether Scan) using the same steps as the testnet but now on mainnet.

The Morpheus Capital Provider Smart Contract Address Is:
Ethereum: Distribution Contract: 0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
 
For those with keen eyes they will note the address that owns the Smart Contracts is not yet the multisig address. This will be updated tomorrow (transferred to the Multisig address) when the Smart Contract devs have confirmed there are no bugs or issues with the Smart Contract deployment.

Finally a huge thank you to the 100+ devs that worked on building Morpheus since September 2nd 2023 and the broader community for spreading the word about how important Decentralized AI is. This is a long term project and is being built by passionate people. Whatever challenges lie ahead I look forward to navigating them with all the builders here working to make Morpheus and the Smart Agents deployed on this platform ever better.

Sucessfully deposited! 

TIPS:

There are 2 steps. 

For the first step of "Approval" I had to enter the number manually or click "max". 

Then the rest went smooth for the second step of staking.

Whales will borrow millions for 90 days and stake, then they will withdraw their millions and give them back

are there any incentives for those who participated and collected MOR on the testnet?


[2/8/2024 7:09 PM] shah96.
its about 0.48 per MOR per block for capital. (0.48 divided by how many in the pool is your amount per block)

Looks like the Dashboard is seeing a lot of traffic. Try following this guide if the Dashboard is not loading. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/English-Guides/SepoliaCapitaProvisionTestnetGuide.md And use the Mainnet address instead of the testnet one.

42 Million is the cap
let's assume a 100 Million USD valuation in 90 days
1.3M MOR tokens on LP launch day in 3 months
$76 MOR divided into 1.3M (not FDV)
let's say you invest .0003% (3 stETH out of 10k)

after seven days you can withdraw


[2/8/2024 8:21 PM] the77helios
basically yea. If you withdraw early, no penalty I don't believe.. but you miss the opertunity of most emissions (early in the curve)

No penalties for withdrawing. Everyone receives the emissions they've earned but must remain staked for a minimum of 7 days.

1) While anonymous they were verified by a reputable third party auditor as part of the audit process
2) Each key holder was confirmed as an Independent party and not with the same company, 
3) Multi-sig doesn't have power over the stETH

Hi all, new to the discord here. How do I get stETH to qualify for $MOR in May?


[2/8/2024 8:42 PM] _flawka
buy on uniswap or a cex, or deposit eth on lido's website to get steth


[2/8/2024 8:42 PM] erikvoorhees
Best way to get stETH is on Curve.  Trade ETH for stETH


[2/8/2024 8:43 PM] erikvoorhees
stETH is the staked derivative version of ETH, from Lido.

Only yield of stETH within the period of time will be determined how many you will receive $MOR? 

Am I correct ?

is MOR awarded at the end of the day equally to everyone who was deposited at the time?
or
its awarded every block, depending how many steth is in, so super early depositors already have a head start?


[2/8/2024 9:23 PM] smartagents
I think its every block. But we are literally only a few hours in : )
And its only 3,456 MOR per day. The Capital Providing function goes on for a long long time.

The yield (in stETH) from all of it is held by Morpheus as protocol owned liquidity. Half this amount is traded into MOR (or will be, after the 90 day bootstrapping period ends). 

Thereafter, Morpheus continues collecting yield and building liquidity for MOR indefinitely.


[2/8/2024 9:39 PM] erikvoorhees
It's good that you're checking/skeptical. I'm not posting on twitter for now, dashboard isn't loading, I don't want more traffic. Also nice to give those who have been here in discord community more time in the early yield.

The first 90 days are the "bootstrapping period" where you can claim your MOR at day 91. But the Capital Provider MOR rewards go for the whole 16 years of the Supply Curve, so Stake as long as you want to keep earning MOR.

No max on stETH. MOR is limited to 42 Million supply emitted over a 16 years supply curve.

Github says stETH not claimable until after 91 days and website says 7 days. Which is it?


[2/8/2024 10:19 PM] smartagents
There is a decay rate every day on emissions. 
MOR will become ever more scarce as the emission rate declines over time.


[2/8/2024 10:19 PM] smartagents
See Whitepaper.

So emissions continue after Day 7 and more days you stake after Day 7, more MOR tokens you earn?

Emissions will last at least for 16 years of the first epoch and supposedly 256 years after. You earn MOR while your capital is in the contract.

are there plans to have proofs returned from compute providers as well? The idea of the network is for censorship resistant inference on public models (as I understand it), but without a proof (via something like ezkl) that the model was run without adjustment (or that an entirely different model was run -- or no model at all), it seems that censorship is still trivially possible on this network as it stands?

[2/9/2024 5:49 AM] nit0r
yeah so if you wanted to stake say 5 steth, you approved the contract to spend 5 steth, then after your transaction the allowance(approval amount) of the contract should be zero.


[2/9/2024 5:49 AM] nit0r
for example i approved 2 steth over what i staked, and now my allowance is 2, because i spent the rest of that allowance


[2/9/2024 5:49 AM] nit0r
its not a constant


[2/9/2024 5:49 AM] nit0r
unless you did infinite approval

[2/9/2024 6:09 AM] vizor9
This isn't something positive lol, basically you had whales all over the Dapp taking out 400-800e loans just to snipe it and withdraw the stETH in 7 days. They'll pay the loan back and take out 50x of what everyone else will get in tokens after the 90 days end

[2/9/2024 11:18 AM] the77helios
all defi interactions need two transactions
1- approve spending of token with specific contract
2- sending approved tokens to the contract

you have to give it permission, then do it.. and gas is way higher than $10 to do step 2 right now lol

[2/9/2024 11:25 AM] the77helios
you may not have paid enough gas for it to go through.. have you done much other defi interactions prior ? There is always a learning stage for it.. we've all lost plenty of money doing it lol


[2/9/2024 11:34 AM] erikvoorhees
The stETH is locked for 7 days, then can be withdrawn or left for further reward.

3 months is the period of bootstrapping, in which the MOR token is not transferrable.

It is.


[2/9/2024 11:35 AM] 0xmoneybagz
Can we see how much tokens we will receive when supplying 1 eth ?


[2/9/2024 11:36 AM] erikvoorhees
There is a token but it cannot be moved for first 90 days. This is to let the emissions play out for a while before trading happens (otherwise if trading happened on day 1, with supply starting from zero, you get crazy absurd prices)

It doesn't seem to work, even after I approve the first transaction, it asks me to approve again and again. I did it 4 times.


[2/9/2024 11:37 AM] the77helios
and does it show up as approved on etherscan ? Does it say failed in your wallet ?


[2/9/2024 11:37 AM] the77helios
or it shows as suceeded. Do not try more until you figure this out

you can simulate the transaction, and get a stack trace.

I have tried 5 times already. It shows succeeded for all 5 transactions when I go to etherscan

umm... make sure to DYOR on websites before connecting your wallet

hush, tenderly is good. u dont need a wallet


[2/9/2024 11:43 AM] the77helios
then try clearing your browser cache, going to the dashboard again and seeing if it progresses you to the deposit transaction

you will notice it will cost much more in gas, and ask how much of the approved tokens you want to transfer


[2/9/2024 11:43 AM] the77helios
don't hush me bro lol

A little less user friendly.. but pretty straight forward. Hardest part is putting 18 `0`s after your desired amount

I tried this approach as well. I am stuck where it says go to the "Then, you need to go to the Distribution contract, open the ‚ÄúContract‚Äù tab, then the ‚ÄúWrite as Proxy‚Äù tab.
Don't forget to connect your wallet,.." on this second step, it wouldn't want to connect with my wallet. It does it for the first step, but not for the distribution contact.

This is not how it works, Morpheus provides daily emissions to reward 4 categories of core contributors. For Capital providers, it's ~3456/day and declines to 0 for 16 years.

üì¢ Friendly reminder Morpheans1
As some fellas reported scam attempts recently,  here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

**Status:**
So far 32,572 stETH have been staked into the Capital Provider Smart Contract. 
This stETH yield will offer a great deal of liquidity for Coders, Compute, and Community to extend the Morpheus tech and network.
https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital Dashboard is looking good.

**Multisig Addresses:**
As planned, the Morpheus Smart Contracts have been transferred to the Multisig addresses for both Ethereum & Arbitrum.
Multisig Address for Ethereum: 0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E
Multisig Address for Arbitrum: 0x151c2b49CdEC10B150B2763dF3d1C00D70C90956

You can validate the owner of the Smart Contracts going to Etherscan by Clicking "Contract", Click "Read As Proxy" and Click "Owner".
See image attached in the #üîäÔ∏±announcements channel. List of Smart Contracts.

Ethereum:
Distribution: https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
L1Sender: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2Efd4430489e1a05A89c2f51811aC661B7E5FF84

Arbitrum:
L2TokenReceiver: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
L2MessageReceiver: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd4a8ECcBe696295e68572A98b1aA70Aa9277d427
MOR: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7431aDa8a591C955a994a21710752EF9b882b8e3
Note for the MOR token contract its owner is L2MessageReceiver.

**Next Upgrades**
Based on good community suggestions there are a set of upgrades to be developed by the open source devs next to improve the Dashboard and Smart Contracts. These are:
1. Prepare code for transition to the MOR.ETH ENS domain.
2. Add "wallet connect" to give users options beyond Meta Mask.
3. Add a recipient field when user claims MOR.
4. Outputting stETH accidentally sent directly to the Contract Address to a smart contract to return to senders.
5. Add switches between testnet and mainnet.

Have a great weekend everyone!

@Erik Voorhees given how technical this project is (for me atleast), but is it safe to assume that for the most part Morpheus architecture will be similar to that of Bittensor ?


[2/10/2024 6:44 AM] erikvoorhees
No not safe to assume that. It's fairly different.  Bittensor is a Polkadot parachain, with customizable software built on top to help train AI models.   Morpheus isn't trying to train models, and has nothing to do with Polkadot.  Bittensor is technically a PoS chain, and Morpheus is not a chain at all.

just in case someone reads this later, Bittensor is not a polkadot parachain and has nothing to do with polkadot in reality. They won a slot but don‚Äôt use it as its governance is too slow. It uses the substrate code base (which is agnostic) for the chain but that‚Äôs about it

{Reactions}
Check (2) 

[2/10/2024 8:35 AM] mahalleinirx
They use substrate and they are a parachain, regardless if they advertise it or not, they don't because Polkadot is now a negative signal and people start using app-chain rather than parachain, same thing


[2/10/2024 8:36 AM] dayerguy
a parachain uses the core validator shared security (which is one of the core tenets of dot). Bittensor does not use them and as a result is not a parachain


[2/10/2024 8:54 AM] pepedzekichen
They use polkadot sdk but are not a parachain


[2/10/2024 8:55 AM] jabo38.
So is a like a parachain that isn‚Äôt anchored to the main chain then?


[2/10/2024 8:59 AM] dayerguy
It uses substrate (which is a agnostic blockchain framework written in rust) but has all its own architecture and runs its own infra. It also uses its own built Yuma consensus. Its architecture is very different from polkadot


[2/10/2024 9:00 AM] dayerguy
no technical communication with anything polkadot related. so not a parachain at all @jabo38.

staking is used in the network for certain aspects but the whole thing relies on the incentivized PoW for the intelligence produced so in reality some sort of hybrid/new thing not yet named? üòÇ ... its something that leverages blockchain for the distribution of rewards but the core consensus is very different than traditional PoS (much more similar to what mor does)

For me MOR is like a trusted friend, you know it's like one of those guys that you just click with right away and you know  that both of you are going to make lots of money, I personally am really looking forward to a very long financial relationship  with Mor and learn to use all of those really kool ideas of having your own AI to help you understand the in's and outs... But I think the big one would be that MOR is decentralized and user friendly..... And lastly I very much like the idea of a fair start, as it looks like you get what you put into it, so I can certainly wait for 90 days as I am pretty sure Santa Claus is coming early this year..!!

do we get the stETH back after a period or is it gone and we get MOR tokens back


[2/10/2024 12:52 PM] smartagents
You can withdraw your original stETH after 7 days.
The daily rebase reward (stETH yield) gets added to the Protocol Owned Liquidity of Morpheus forever.
So you are providing yield which increases the liquidity for everyone and earning MOR.

Can there be a smart agent that is "owned" or working for by a collective of people?


[2/10/2024 1:13 PM] touristcontrol
Like a General Smart Agent?


[2/10/2024 1:16 PM] smartagents
Really good questions. I'd say check out the #ü§ñÔ∏±smart-agent-devs chat channel. Lot of interesting discussion on that topic to be had.


[2/10/2024 1:16 PM] touristcontrol
and as a seperate question, after development has taken place is it feasible to imagine something where I can tell my personal smart agent to take my ETH and use it to execute MEV based strategies automatically. And it is hands off from then?


[2/10/2024 1:17 PM] smartagents
Oh yeah. I'm sure devs will make DeFi use cases for Smart Agents. That's really low hanging fruit. Just wrap some DeFi Smart Contracts ABI calls into the chat Interface.


[2/10/2024 1:17 PM] touristcontrol
Where can I see some imagined use cases that aren't so low level fruit?


[2/10/2024 1:17 PM] touristcontrol
any body put together some sort of write up or summary?


[2/10/2024 1:18 PM] touristcontrol
Also, there's a ton of value in listing and marketing related functions. How will it get determined if MOR or even STETH yield will get allocated there. Is MOR a governance token?


[2/10/2024 1:22 PM] smartagents
Smart Agents Github has some of that. Would be great to see a whole website about it.

looks like gas prices finally going down 'kind of' lol.. Seeing if ETH drops for a nice dip or gas lower tomorrow to stake these bad boys


[2/10/2024 1:23 PM] smartagents
No governance token. No stETH yield from Capital Providers get allocated to anyone or anything other than protocol owned liquidity.
Daily 50% of yield will buy MOR from the Uniswap pool and 50% of the stETH will be an LP in the pool.


[2/10/2024 1:24 PM] smartagents
It acts as the boot strapping mechanism and builds demand side for every contributor in Morpheus if they are a Coder, Compute Provider or Community builder. Check the paper its got lots of good examples.

How many MOR per stETH we getting per day?


[2/10/2024 1:38 PM] antonb
Currently it's ~7,7 MOR per 1 deposited stETH over bootstrapping period (90 days)


[2/10/2024 1:43 PM] merchantofweb3
How do we know this?


[2/10/2024 1:51 PM] antonb
It's called math )
**Yield of MOR on 1ETH deposit = MOR emissions for the Capital Providers / Average total pooled stETH for 90 days**
Yield of MOR on 1ETH deposit = 308,666 / 40,000 = 7.71 MOR per 1 deposited ETH over 90 days

The roadmap is layed out for the "google moment" of blockchain. 

Before google the internet was a bit clunky, then Google showed up and there was just a box where you typed what you wanted. 

We're building this for crypto. Ultimately personal agents will be able to interact with other agents on your behalf. 

Version 0.0.6 has integration with wallets. Version 0.0.7 is looking to have agents. Check out the Smart Agent Devs section. Some very cool things being built.

It seems wrong as deposits are constantly growing. When the pool becomes kind of stable, you'll get a more or less precise rate.

Hi. You should consider a few factors: emissions are declining over 16 years to 0 and you get rewards only when your stETH are in the contract.
Also in the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs you can find information that will help you make the decision.

You can't, until bootstrapping period is over (~May 9th). At the moment, the only way to obtain MOR tokes is through contribution either code to Morpheus repo or Capital in form of stETH deposit.


[2/10/2024 6:30 PM] antonb
To quickly jump in the loop with everything, I'd suggest starting with #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs


[2/10/2024 6:30 PM] pxxhtr

[2/10/2024 6:32 PM] antonb
It's not quite allocation, but more like competition between depositors for a sweet part of MOR emissions.


[2/10/2024 6:34 PM] pxxhtr
It might be better to just buy after 90 days then

Morpheus utilizes novel way of launch called TCM, Techno Capital Machine, when users deposit their assets which generate yield (stETH) and this yield used to create liquidity. For your contribution you'll get a part of daily MOR emissions pro rata to your share in the total pool.
So far deposited 41000k+ stETH

The thing is that, it doesn't matter how much you will deposit, you will always have the same APR as someone who invested much more. The only difference, that he will get more tokens as his share in the total pool is bigger.


[2/11/2024 1:07 AM] niddy8596
Thank you. So to be clear the APR would be the upside for small fish. Looking in price-discussion, it says I'd likely only get 7.7 MOR per ETH deposited. I'm not fudding, the project is great, but with 1-2 ETH i may be just as well off using that elsewhere and buying the token in 90 days. Is that fair?

I can't say it's unfair that someone has more money than me. The fairness here that everyone have the same opportunities and conditions. And you get exactly what you invested. Guys who invested millions take huge risks and greatly contribute to protocol liquidity and they are rewarded accordingly.

think you guys will probably need to be more strict in PRs and code contributions or you'll find yourself in a position where u have hundreds of "fixed typo in README" PRs that will get the same amount of tokens as real devs doing actual work


[2/11/2024 3:15 AM] shaki
i've seen it happen a bunch of times before. Just disencourages real devs from contributing and just leaves the vultures airdrop farmers that google translate documentation


[2/11/2024 3:16 AM] mahalleinirx
They are much more strict now than they used to be, translations also not getting as easily rewarded as most major languages have been already


[2/11/2024 3:16 AM] shaki
that's just my 2 cents and i dont mean any harm to ppl that actually contribute to docs ofc. You know the type of contributor i'm talking about

Although I can understand your concerns here

All good. Fair feedback. The best practices around this have been evolving.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/8.Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md Ultimately its the responsibility of each repo owner to only merge in code they see as valuable. Given it dilutes their own hours contributed they have a real incentive to only select pull requests that add real value and make it more likely their code is used & rewarded on the Morpheus platform.

This is embedded function of the protocol that generate liquidity in the novel way called Techno Capital Machine. If curious, I can share a doc describing it in depth.


[2/11/2024 4:01 AM] antonb
No need to hurry, but from what I see, the competition for the MOR emissions is getting really rough


[2/11/2024 4:20 AM] nit0r
No but is +ev to deposit earlier since there is no cap on tvl so pool can get very diluted


[2/11/2024 5:08 AM] mahalleinirx
Apparently due to the nature of the emissions the apy remains quite high

[2/11/2024 12:51 PM] smartagents
You can't purchase MOR tokens yet.
90 day boot strapping period right now.
Only way to get MOR is earn it. Provide Capital or Code.


[2/11/2024 12:52 PM] hardi6985
so we can add eth at any time during the project life time. is that understanding correct


[2/11/2024 12:52 PM] hardi6985
wow


[2/11/2024 12:54 PM] smartagents
stETH Correct. Though the emissions rate declines at a small rate every day. So first 5 years half of tokens are emitted. Ever more scarce. So competition may increase for MOR over time. But yeah 24% of daily emissions go to Capital Providers. It adds liquidity to the Protocol Owned Liquidity for everyone.


[2/11/2024 12:55 PM] smartagents
Only the yield gets contributed (rebasing reward from stETH) you can withdraw your original stETH when ever after 7 days.


[2/11/2024 12:55 PM] smartagents
Claim the MOR you earned after 87 days from now.


[2/11/2024 12:56 PM] hardi6985
whats the yield atm for steth u distribute to capital providers?

Nope. MOR are only claimable day 90 of the Fair Launch. 87 days to go.

Good question. We need to ask @potato on formula, but I can assume it's also depends on ETH price

if stEth stake remains static and fdv is higher, return is higher.

gm all, been researching the protocol lately, i'm finding it very inriguing, here's a highlevel overview of my current understanding, hoping you could help me understand if i misunderstood somenthing:
morpheus is a decentralized, community owned, smart agent platform. smart agents are agents that can interact with smart contracts, streamlinining the process of navigating on chain, and performing tasks on user's behalf (with user approval in wallet). the use cases are limited to the developer's imagination, ultimetely morpheus vision is to build an app-store like store for smart agents.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[2/11/2024 7:23 PM] antonb
If your goal is to describe Morpheus in a few lines, then that's a great description.
But I would also add that from a larger scale view Morpheus is essentially a global Web3 infrastructure for building and developing solutions based on decentralized AI, everything you need (incl finance) in one place, which, in addition to its unique architecture, utilizes innovative approaches in tokenomics.
I think other fellas will add more too.


[2/11/2024 7:24 PM] mariocandia
thank you very much, this really helps


[2/11/2024 7:26 PM] antonb
May I know what purpose do you research Morpheus for?


[2/11/2024 7:26 PM] mariocandia
from my understanding morpheus' differentiator is the personal AI. how will it work is still unclear to me, but i imagine, users downloading their chosen smart agent (which is specialized for a specific task), run it locally (or on cloud)?


[2/11/2024 7:27 PM] mariocandia
ofc, i'm looking to invest and potentially contribute with capital, not technical, so this is the best way i can help the community


[2/11/2024 7:27 PM] antonb

> how will it work is still unclear to me
More than hundred, incl. top industry devs are doing magic to make it work :AI: :Node:


[2/11/2024 7:32 PM] mariocandia
another thing, who runs smart agents? is there an individual operator or multiple operators?


[2/11/2024 7:33 PM] mariocandia
i believe agents can also communicate/access web 2 informations, correct?


[2/11/2024 7:34 PM] antonb
Nice questions, I feel someone with more robust tech background and most up to date information should address them as Morpheus evolving from the light speed.

1) who runs smart agents? is it an individual operator or multiple operators? is there a slashing mechanism to prevent malicious behaviour?
2) do agents operate off chain (perform computations etc..) and just perform tasks on chain?
3) are morpheus' agentic services only limited to web 3?
4) is the network's main focus on end users? or agentic services can also be utilized by dapps to aumotate specific tasks and innovate by building new use cases?
5) is there an SDK/development framework in order to help devs in the process od developing smart agents?
6) are smart agents composable?
7) on what chains will smart agents be available?

Morpheus fair launched 3 days ago on Feb 8th


[2/11/2024 7:52 PM] antonb
7 days it's an initial deposit lock after which you can withdraw any time
90 days is the bootstrapping period


[2/11/2024 7:53 PM] peter_antswap
Oh so we can unlock if we want after 4 days and if we want to continue earning mor then we have to keep steth locked ...right?

You can't withdraw stETH for the first 7 days, no locks after that.
You earn rewards until your stETH in the contract and you considered as Capital provider. When you withdraw, accrue of rewards also stop.
It's everything well explained in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

from what i gathered, my understanding is that an SDK is underdevelopment (cosmos, ethereum, polygon, avalanche, bitcoin).
composability between agent services is possible in the "METROPOLIS" phase of smart agent development

üì¢ Friendly reminder Morpheans!
As some fellas reported scam attempts recently,  here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO private token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

Yea


[2/12/2024 12:42 AM] antonb
TCM is universal mechanism of creation liquidity for protocol development and rewarding Capital contributors, so yes, any token or set of tokens could be use.
If your question specifically about Morpheus, there is a chance that other tokens will complement stETH.

hi all, do rewards end on the 15th once people can withdraw the eth or will they continue for 90 days if we leave the eth in staked?


[2/12/2024 3:52 AM] tigerbuidl.
the rewards will continue for the 90 days and as long as you have your stETH in the contract (I think)


[2/12/2024 3:53 AM] smartagents
@Felix 
- 7 days is just the length before you can withdraw stETH.
- Every day you keep the stETH deposited you earn additional MOR tokens.
- Day 90 (May 8th) the MOR tokens become claimable / sendable / tradable.
- The MOR rewards for Capital Providers (stETH) follow at 16 year long emissions curve. 
- So keep that stETH in there as long as you want to get additional MOR rewards.

Correct. The protocol only uses the yield (daily stETH rebase reward) to add to its Protocol Owned Liquidity. You can withdraw the original stETH amount when ever you want.

Really good questions.
1. Depends on who deployed the Smart Agent. Could be an individual or team of devs. Think of it in the terms of a Smart Contract. Who owns it? Depends on the Smart Contract. Slashing no. Evaluation before being included in Morpheus Front Ends yes.
2. Again depends on how the Smart Agent is structured, but a simple case would be an agent that just executes some Smart Contract action and is connected to Morpheus for interacting via chat.
3. No limit to Web3, someone could build a Web2 agent, but the "Smart" comes in if the agent wants to interact with a Smart Contract or take some action that requires value. Considering all devs want to get paid at least having an an address for Agent is a minimum.
4. Morpheus is agnostic to if the user is a dev or end user. But having a reward to the Community Builders (front ends) it should create an incentive for interfaces to reach all the way to the end user.
5. There is some documentation on the Smart Agents Github. Lots more to develop post Compute going live.
https://github.com/SmartAgentProtocol/SmartAgents/blob/main/White%20Paper.md
Also version 0.0.7 of Morpheus will be the first agentic one with LLM + Wallet + Agents.
6.  I certainly hope they can be developed to be composable. 
7. Morpheus is chain agnostic. Starting on Ethereum, Arbitrum, community interest in Cosmos, Solana, Avalanche and other chains.

No. Nothing is happening on arbitrum atm. In 90 days when the token is distributed it will be claimable on arbitrum


[2/12/2024 4:24 AM] antonb
You need ETH on Ethereum mainnet and stake it through Lido in order to obtain stETH.


[2/12/2024 4:25 AM] the77helios
You can also swap on a DEX *

To make it clear, stETH is a yield generating token that represents an Ethereum token that is staked in Lido.

Can I send using arbitrum and it still ends up on etherum network? (Or at least I bridge it over?) what‚Äôs the best way of anybody has experience in this please

I have checked the code hawks audit.. There is critical issue for withdrawals of the MOR tokens which is seems to be not solved.. Are they guyz working on it?

I'm sure that all the stated in the report issues have been solved before the contracts deployed


[2/12/2024 4:34 AM] antonb
Either way they won't be deployed as security is #1 priority

Fair launch?

Would of been on Arbitrum with a mechanism that doesn't only benefit whales with a spare 20-40 ETH lying around.

The concept of raising capital using yield etc is fine, however light years away from being egalitarian or a project launch for the masses

Community = Value

Largest base for larger community, not a whale fest.

the dollar value actually remains the same in theory regardless of how many whales enter (because they generate more yield for the LP).. so it is actually pretty fair

fair means everyone plays by the same rules.. not that wealth distribution happens like communism lol.. but logistically imposible to prevent same person from making multiple wallets and depositing..

Agree community is king. 
However the only means to a different approach on Capital Providers would have been far worse.
1. Limits per address, which doesn't work due to sybil attack (people can spin up lots of addresses for free). 
2. KYC, which would have prevented many people around the world from participating + added friction + permission + cost.
**Equality of opportunity is the ideal, equality of outcome is impossible. **

Plus Morpheus lets you earn via Code, Compute, or Community Building (Front Ends) all of these types of value get rewarded equal to ALL the Capital Providers. Most projects only reward capital (Proof of Stake) or compute (Proof of Work) and forget about Coders & Community. Morpheus rewards literally anyone willing to put in any type of value that adds to the Network : )

Plus no pre-mine. No team tokens. No inside info. Announced long in advance. Open source developed in public since day 1.

Hi. It's likely because the amount you earned so far is too small.


[2/12/2024 5:14 PM] antonb
If you want to see your MOR rewards right now, you can do that through the contract.
You need to call the `getCurrentUserReward` function (#2), where you need to enter pool number (`0`) and your address. Click "Query".  
After that click on the number you get and you'll see your rewards next to Ether field.

Even if you removed the part where OpenAI explained you meaning of my answers, it's still AI created text. 

As I said. The launch will be on Uniswap Arbitrum. And my sincere advice is, before you come and copy-paste messages about your launchpad, you need to show respect and at least read the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs to learn basic information, that would greatly contribute to the conversion rate.

Morpheus will have token launch on Uniswap on Arbitrum and not interested in launchpads, but you are free to buy from the market and sell to your users if this is your plan.

Non-aggregate (treats each transaction seperatley) representation of MOR earnings compared to the ammount of eth staked.
The number on top of the markers, its ETH staked, the number on the bottom is share of daily rewards.
Ex. 
1% = ~354 MOR/day

Depositing of stETH is on Ethereum and MOR token with AMM liquidity is on Arbitrum.

[2/13/2024 2:26 PM] antonb
Correct. You can only deposit stETH and be rewarded with MOR token on Ethereum mainnet


[2/13/2024 2:28 PM] antonb
üì¢ Friendly reminder Morpheans!
As some fellas reported scam attempts recently,  here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO private token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

[2/13/2024 2:34 PM] cattaput123
Actually curious why steth and not normal eth? Like I read the faq, they say yield generated from steth. Is the stEth like loan to other dex for example and the interest generated there = the yield to fund the liquidity pool?


[2/13/2024 2:35 PM] antonb
Because stETH is a yield generating token that represents an Ethereum token that is staked in Lido.


[2/13/2024 2:35 PM] antonb
The yield comes from Ethereum staking rewards


[2/13/2024 2:37 PM] antonb
I don't think that stETH is the loan, rather contribution to Morpheus success in form of yield.


[2/13/2024 2:38 PM] cattaput123
I thought that yield isn‚Äôt redeemed until Eth 2.0?


[2/13/2024 2:38 PM] antonb
The yield is paid by Lido

[2/13/2024 2:50 PM] antonb
Usually Lido's APR in range from 3,2% to 3,5% and yes, this is the way how the protocol utilize yield generated by stETH and transform it into Protocol owned Liquidity.


[2/13/2024 2:53 PM] dugdisc

Guys im kind of lost here , so there is a total deposit of 52626 stETH in the pool . If the current daily reward is 3453.0372 MOR, does that mean you have to deposit 1.5 stETH (around 40k usd) to make sure to have 1 MOR per day ? isnt that alot ?

In the near time there will be feature added to the calculator that would help you understand how much MOR you can earn before May 9th. Keep noted that this amount isn't constant and can decrease (if more deposits come) or increase (if there are some withdrawals).


[2/14/2024 1:22 AM] getmonero

Be careful of OTC or secondary markets.
NO one has MOR until May 8th.

Today is a exciting day for the Morpheus Community.

@Ishshogun @domsteil Lochsbagel @Maxwell_Smart_Agent and other open source devs have built the first Smart Agent on Morpheus via the experimental 0.0.6 version. 

See images attached. 
The local LLM interprets the intent of the request (using Smart Rank). 
Creates the transaction. 
Prompts Meta Mask and asks for the user's review and approval. Amazing first.

its relative. you are thinking in terms of dollar value, without considering that the more eth is staked, the higher the price. your output will be the same in terms of dollars, the only thing that gets diluted is the number of tokens.

[2/14/2024 6:57 AM] shiny_shiba_
Morpheus seems like it could plug into a lot of the intent-based protocols coming online / already online as a solver. Feels like a very deterministic thing as well - like you either got the user best pricing on a swap or you didn't 

Anyone else thinking about this for smart agents?


[2/14/2024 6:57 AM] nate102003
So this gonna fairly launch?


[2/14/2024 6:58 AM] shiny_shiba_
DEX can support liquidity, look at TAO (wrapped TAO specifically). CEX will list if MOR grows traction. CEX listing is byproduct of success, not the driver of success.

low liquidity prob will prevent large dumps - having deep liquid Binance CEX listing day 1 actually prob means more can dump haha

[2/14/2024 7:02 AM] mahalleinirx
Why are you assuming low liquidity?


[2/14/2024 7:04 AM] shiny_shiba_
I am assuming *relatively* lower liquidity than if there was a team that went out to ensure day 1 listings across major cex's


[2/14/2024 7:04 AM] shiny_shiba_
WTAO has $4.9M liquidity for example, not very high. Don't think that's a big deal in early days btw, like i said, liquidity forms as a byproduct of success
https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x433a00819c771b33fa7223a5b3499b24fbcd1bbc


[2/14/2024 7:09 AM] mahalleinirx
How much liquidity would you say is good?


[2/14/2024 7:13 AM] shiny_shiba_
Market makers would have a much better answer than me but i don't think it's like one number (i.e. once you're at $10M liquidity "it's good"). Generally like a % of liquidity to the FDV of the token and measured in how much slippageu get on like $10K, $100K sized market orders

So like TAO and WTAO liquidity pretty low relative to the FDV (not saying this makes TAO bad or anything, just a fact. I like TAO)

But $10M of onchain liquidity for a $20M fdv token? that would be really really good. $5M of onchain liquidity for $1B fdv token? not really that good


[2/14/2024 7:14 AM] 1272
FDV is not a good basis while ~6% of supply is circulaing


[2/14/2024 7:14 AM] shiny_shiba_
That's why I was chatting in the tokenomics channel in nov/early december that half of the steth yield generated should go to buy MOR and the other half should be in ETH to LP and burn LP token so you at least build up some locked liquidity generated by the protocol itself. Glad it is on the site now b/c i think that will make for a healthier maket / bootstrap liquidity to start


[2/14/2024 7:14 AM] shiny_shiba_
Yea that's fair just take ciruclating supply mkt cap then instead of fdv


[2/14/2024 7:15 AM] shiny_shiba_
I agree, better to look at circ supply market cap so just like mentally ctrl+f / replace FDV with circ supply mkt cap in my prev message üôè


[2/14/2024 7:16 AM] 1272
Okay, 1.5m liq for 14m 'fdv'

[2/14/2024 7:16 AM] shiny_shiba_

After bootstrapping, 50% of the yield will be used to buy MOR from the market, pair with another 50% and again added into the LP as Protocol owned Liquidity.


[2/14/2024 12:40 PM] antonb
From the one side of the pair and stETH from the other.


[2/14/2024 12:40 PM] touristcontrol
so after the bootstrap, the liquidity will continue to get deeper?


[2/14/2024 12:40 PM] touristcontrol
all of the yield will be paired with this 51444?


[2/14/2024 12:40 PM] antonb
Of couse, liquidity is in the heart


[2/14/2024 12:41 PM] antonb
Yep, that's exactly what I meant


[2/14/2024 12:41 PM] mahalleinirx
Don't forget that people can add more liquidity to the pool once the 90day period finishes too

Such the precise and elegant formulated thought! This is exactly what I think about.
When someone asks me "What is Morpheus?", I'm a bit struggle, as just saying "It's the network for powering Smart agent's"; "It's global infrastructure for DeAI soultions"; "It's Bitcoin, but AI" oe "It's like app store for AI" isn't fully imply the deeper idea.

If you burn, you can't reinvest collected fees. Maybe alternative solution would be to burn the keys from the contract that ensures reinvesting.

Hey :wave_animated: Please allow me to ask a rather provocative question about the product itself.

I've been following the project since the first version, I'm trying to organize a meetup in Berlin together with @LSC and I'm basically pro-blockchain. Nevertheless, I keep asking myself what added value Morpheus wants to offer compared to the technological basis Ollama. I watched the interview with @David Johnston  yesterday and am still enthusiastic about his euroria. üòç  Nevertheless, each of his arguments (AI must be decentralised, the history showed that closed solutions like OpenAI are bad, the UI have to be easy for everyoneand so on.) is also valid for the technological basis Ollama, which is used by Morpheus. As I said, please don't take this as an offence, but I'm working PM for decades and may be a bit critical. However, I really want to understand what the vision is and how Morpheus want to differentiate from the OSS AI community besides the current ("falsish") arguments.

:Heart:


[2/14/2024 4:28 PM] antonb
Hello. It's great question and topic raised.
Am I right that you actually say, we can now remove everything we have on Morpheus Github, replace it with Ollama and this will be the same product/idea?


[2/14/2024 4:32 PM] antonb
Don't get me wrong, or offensive, but you talk about arguments, when you don‚Äôt give any. I said that in order to understand what you imply by word "arguments" and how to distinguish "falsish" from "truish"?


[2/14/2024 4:36 PM] antonb
Does the vision you shared includes such things as value to end users as IMHO I don't think they in any extend care about technological basis as they just need "solution".


[2/14/2024 4:44 PM] hvbx
No not everything, in the meaning of the whole Morpheus project. Theo repo is more then just the product I'm talking about. But yes a user could use Ollama instead of Morpheus and would have the  same advantages (Open source, independence, custom models, ....).


[2/14/2024 4:46 PM] hvbx

[2/14/2024 4:50 PM] hvbx
I'm using Ollama much longer then Morpheus and may be biased :pinahide: , but that's why I'm asking. What is the point in the vision that distinguishes Morpheus from Ollama?


[2/14/2024 4:55 PM] antonb
Seems like we are talking on the current version of the Morpheus, but not what is he strives to be.
Again, just my thought and understanding of Morpheus advantages over Ollama from ordinal web3 user standpoint:
- I'm in web3 and I'd never heard of Ollama, but I still in Morpheus
- I have no clue what is Ollama, but I quite understand Morpheus
- Ollama doesn't have such incredible persons as David and Erik
- Likely there will be no Ollama token, means no tokenomics, no incentives, no web3 users
- Ollama isn't web3 friendly
- Ollama won't execute actions with my wallet based on my intention (or will be?)
- I see Ollama as the donor, which makes 100% sense. Start rapidly with Ollama, develop and evolve, rather than build everything from scratch.
This is what first comes to mind.


[2/14/2024 4:56 PM] antonb
I understand your point and really intrigued to listen to David's answer.


[2/14/2024 4:59 PM] antonb
I can guess that these arguments in first order are addressed to wide audience, if there were technical discussion, they might have been different.
But thanks again for raising that, as it lets you think out-of-the-box.

we aren't just a UI, we have blockchain integration and provide compute for end users.
webui solving "more problems" is too general, I have not see webui but i'd imaging the scope is far beyond web3, with potential for a slight overlap. 
most people cant run llms on their PC, as you mentioned earlier you built one specifically for that

Its a good question. Ollama is part of the tech stack, but Morpheus includes a lot of pieces in the tech stack. The Electron to make install easy, the UI to make it accessible to non technical people, the wallet integration (Meta Mask) to connect transactions, the Smart Rank embeddings to give the LLM wisdom of what to recommend to the user to use, the ABI connections to the highest ranking smart contracts to making triggering Smart Contracts easy, and soon the Smart Agents built by the community to add many more actions accessible to the user. 

Add to all of that the incentive layer. Which provides resources to encourage devs to open source their agents, capital for compute, and community built front ends. It really takes all these pieces. If you only had Ollama you only have one piece of the tech stack.

Thanks for your feedback. Except of the "incentive layer" every other piece is just needed because it's running on web3. To summarize: The advantage over a OSS solution is currently the a) included UI and b) the "incentive layer"? (Where the UI isn't currently an advantage since the webui for Ollama is already much more advanced and more feature complete than Morpheus 0.0.5, even this isn't easy to install)

I really thinking about this a lot. From my POV I currently the at least one advantage: The user don't need the compute power in the long run. Just because users of Morpheus could buy computer power for their requests. Ollama always have tu run "locally". (Even their also could buy computer power at a centralized company)

But I hoped (and still hope) that there is something more I currently don't see. What's the a-few-sentences pitch?

Compute is a big reason to have a network. That unlocks large scale projects / diffusion / tasks you would need GPUs for. And I'm sure the UI will evolve based on what the community builds.

# stETH and MOR Token FAQ - Added to Announcements

As day 7 of the Morpheus Fair Launch approaches its best to address some frequently asked questions here so there is an easy place to point people for answers.

The most common questions are:

Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus beyond day 7?
YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 7. 
Every day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards.

Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus past day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 90. Every extra day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards. In fact the Capital Provider reward in Morpheus goes for the entire ~16 year period of the initial supply curve. So keep earning MOR as long as you like : )

When can I withdraw my stETH?
Depends on when you deposited them.
The Smart Contract allows Capital Providers to withdraw 7 days from the time of their individual deposit.

Can I deposit additional stETH?
YES. You can make additional deposits of stETH when ever you like. Each one can be withdrawn after 7 days or longer.

When can I claim the MOR I earned?
The MOR tokens are claimable / sendable on day 90 (May 8th 2024). Don't be fooled by anyone offering to sell MOR before May 8th 2024. There is no pre-mine, there are no team tokens. The only MOR that exist are those fairly earned.

How many MOR will I earn for depositing stETH?
This is hard to predict so early on. However there is a website a community member put up that tries to run some of these estimates / calculations. https://morstats.info/  
Credit to @chasingdreams 

What can I use MOR tokens for when I can claim it?
The first utility of MOR is to access Inference / Compute for running Smart Agents. Every person that holds MOR will get a pro-rata amount of access to the Compute offered to the Morpheus network. Think of it as Staking or Hodling for Inference or Intelligence : ) See Yellowstone paper for details. This aspect is still under development, but very actively being worked on by many open source devs. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

Secondly, holding MOR may have lot of other benefits related to projects launch on the Techno Capital Machine. As Smart Agents launch on Morpheus and use the same fair launch approach providing MOR yield to these projects is a very interesting way to support more open source projects to use the same staking Smart Contracts and best practices developed by the Morpheus community. See paper here. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

Is it better to provide stETH to earn MOR or buy them on Uniswap day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
While there is a lot of discussion about this question, its impossible to predict as this point. However there is little downside to just doing BOTH. Everyone can earn MOR from their stETH and then on day 90 if MOR is cheap on Uniswap you can always withdraw your stETH and trade it for MOR. 

Oh and there are now 60,000+ stETH staked to the Morpheus Smart Contracts. 
Amazing to see all the passion for Decentralized AI. Keeping being awesome.

Guys, to be able to have some Mor, we have to deposit at least 1 steth, if my calcul is right with 1 steth in 90 days you earn around 5 MOR. Right?

How secure is the project? I know there is always a risk, but someone can tell me how the project is solid and that we will not losse the STETH we deposite. Thanks!!!

Depends on the meaning you give to "mining".
In Morpheus, you can commit code to Github and be rewarded in MOR tokens if it merged.

Hi! Is there a time limit till when I can stake stETH?


[2/15/2024 6:31 AM] shiny_shiba_
you have like 16 years before emissions run out i think - take your time and do your research üôè but do note that the pool likely receives more stETH which means each stETH will earn fewer MOR over time


[2/15/2024 6:35 AM] mindeleven
Does this mean the earlier I stake the more MOR I will earn?


[2/15/2024 6:48 AM] shiny_shiba_
Assuming that there is net inflow vs net outflow of stETH into the contract, yes

{Reactions}
üëç (4) 

[2/15/2024 6:48 AM] salwilliam
A specific amount of MOR is emitted on a schedule to all stETH capital contributors. You earn based on your % of the total amount of stETH contributed. So, your reward amount will adjust dynamically based on how much stETH is staked in total in the contract.

[2/15/2024 7:12 AM] mindeleven
Okay I understand. Thank you for answering my questions


[2/15/2024 7:26 AM] shiny_shiba_
no problem, btw easy way to calculate how much MOR per steth is just do:

(your # of stETH) / (total steth) * Curretn daily reward

So, like 1/61,598*3452 = 0.056 MOR per day per stETH

(based on current numbers)

{Reactions}
üëç 

[2/15/2024 7:27 AM] shiny_shiba_
So over time, if the denominator (total steth) increases, your MOR per ETH goes down. Also keep in mind that current daily reward will go down over time as well. So you can always calculate for yourself ü´°

[2/15/2024 11:17 AM] shredder_gaming
I presume when agents start trading and using MOR they will be using fractions of MOR tokens, rather than a $ Value.  Will this fraction of a token scale during price discovery?


[2/15/2024 11:23 AM] antonb
GM. Smart Agents won't trade or make any actions by themselves, at least not in the near future.
Could you please elaborate more, what's the price discovery phase you imply?


[2/15/2024 11:28 AM] freeman8008
I think he means will the MOR cost of using smart agents scale with the price of the token as it goes up


[2/15/2024 11:46 AM] antonb
Yeah, one of the ways I interpret his question too.
@shredder_gaming 
If this is what you asked for, then answer, yes it would scale. 
Firstly, users will be able to run agent locally and pay nothing,  secondly, as they are the end users, they could pay in any convenient way to the agent/LLM/tool providers, who, in turn, less susceptible to volatility and motivated to accumulate MOR as it gives them daily share of free compute.
There are still some questions that need to be addressed, like fee burn mechanic, but scale dilemma is in focus.
My personal opinion, that we will end up with a hybrid model, where the most of the Morpheus utility will be accessible through staking/holding tokens and minor part will be paid in form of USD/stables to apps/tools/agents builders who will act as proxy.


[2/15/2024 12:54 PM] confusedcollector
if you deposit 10 stETH then you deposit another 5stETH a few days later (day 3) will the original 10 ETH unlock at day 7 (7 days from the original deposit) and the  remaining 5 ETH unlock at day 10 (7 days from the 5 ETH deposit)?


[2/15/2024 12:55 PM] confusedcollector
or does any new stETH deposit delay the unlock of all your prior stETH deposits/

7 days after your individual deposit. That applies going forward. Not just for the first 7 days of the fair launch. Otherwise attackers could game the system and take out the stETH before it provides any yield to the protocol. See #üîäÔ∏±announcements

Thank you, also the more stETH I stake the more MOR tokens I receive on a daily basis as long as I don't withdraw?  For example if I stake $1000 stETH, I should have more daily tokens opposed to if I staked $500?

What would be the process from holding Eth on an exchange to getting it staked for MOR?


[2/15/2024 9:28 PM] antonb
Hi and welcome.
It depends on exchange, some of them have ETH/stETH trading pairs.
You need to have stETH in your wallet, visit Morpheus website and sign approval and stake transactions. Simple as that üôÇ


[2/15/2024 9:29 PM] antonb
If your exchange has to ETH/stETH pair, you can withdraw ETH to your wallet and stake it to Lido directly


[2/15/2024 9:29 PM] luckyjcrypto
So if I can get stETH from exchange, then send it to metamask, connect wallet and set?


[2/15/2024 9:30 PM] antonb
Connect wallet to the Morpheus website and sign approval and stake transactions.

[2/15/2024 10:50 PM] jabo38.
I was wondering about this and had a couple of questions. 

1) Does the account need to lock up said MOR tokens so that x amount of locked tokens gets y amount of queries per z time period? 
2) Will there be some kind of registered delegate key that the local client is using to sign query requests in the background that go out to the network so that a user doesn't have the friction of using a hardware wallet to sign a message each time a query is made?

No need to lock, just HODL

You need to click **"WITHDRAW stETH"** button in your dashboard


[2/15/2024 10:57 PM] antonb
My guess for 2), as I read it from the Yellowstone, there will be like daily snapshot of balances and user will get access through Router frictionless (maybe one time signature will be needed)


[2/15/2024 11:02 PM] jabo38.
I'm trying to mentally figure out the cryptographic transparency how that can be done. Not a developer, but I was wondering if it would look something like the following: 

A) User Morpheus wallet generates key. 
B) User's address signs message registering key that is somehow then linked on chain
C) User's Morpheus wallet uses registered key to then sign query 
D) Network Router checks balance snapshot to see how much compute they have access and accepts or rejects
E) Query goes to network 

Would it work anything like that?

Hello team,I have three questions:
1. At what stage is the project currently? Has the financing amount and roadmap been disclosed?
2. What official tasks are currently underway? Are there any incentives for the community?
3. I have applied to become the ambassador for China. I am currently the ambassador for BotanixLabs, LightLink, TUNACHAIN, and Supra. I have my own active community.
Looking forward to your response.

[2/15/2024 11:30 PM] rcondron
These will be architectural docs for the software development


[2/15/2024 11:30 PM] antonb
Most of them are answered in details in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs , so I'll keep my reply brief:
1. Morpheus has launched in fair way on Feb 8th and now we are in Phase 1 where Capital and Code providers can contribute and be rewarded. The next stages are Phase 2. Compute (~May) and Phase 3. Community builders (interfaces) (~July).
So far 67k+ stETH were deposited, yield from which will be used for liquidity creation.
2. There are no team, founders and formal tasks, as Morpheus is developing in open source manner by 150+ contributors. All the ongoing work is on Github. Right now community can earn MOR tokens by depositing stETH or providing Code to Morpheus repositiry.
3. There is no Ambassador role.

@antonb | will not DM you will the daily emissions of MOR token be sent directly to the 4 C's contributors' wallet or will there be a claim process? 
The LP will simply be used for people to get in and out of MOR token, right? (convert MOR for steth or vise versa)


[2/16/2024 2:44 AM] antonb
It's claim. If interested, I can provide you with a guide on how to explore the process on testnet.

Can you send it to me too? I'm happy to test if needed.

LP will work as any other DEX pool, where you can buy/seee, there won't be any special process.

got it. So on day 91  the pool starts with 51,444 MOR/ accumulated steth yield. If other fair launch token project are any indications, then most will hodle their MOR token while almost million dollars of steth rewards being added to the pool every month. I'm not gonna elaborate of what this will do to the price of MOR as it is a topic for another channel but I believe this will have crazy flywheel effect  on its price which will attract more eyes and attention toward Morpheus. :Check:

Agree with your points, and when compute and community contracts are live it will add more utility and stimulus to hold MOR, as users get free compute.

I spend a lot of time working with current ai tools. Local LLMs, GPT4, stable diffusion, voice cloners, stuff like that. So this project is very interesting to me.

I'm trying to wrap my head around the goals of this project.

This might sound either obvious, or very wrong, but I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. 

The goal is to create Smart Agents that can perform actions in web3 for the user by following simple instructions. So once I install it and connect my wallet, I could tell it to: "Sell 1 ethereum token for USDC on Uniswap", and theoretically, the agent could understand this and perform the action for me. 

Am I close?

It evolves over time with each new release of the Morpheus node


[2/16/2024 5:00 AM] antonb
Current version is 0.0.5, 0.0.6 version will have wallet connections. 0.0.7 will have Smart Contract embeddings.

hi there, can anyone guide me on how this staking actually works?


[2/16/2024 12:08 PM] antonb
Hi. You need to have stETH in your wallet first, then connect to the website, sign approval and stake txs. That's it.
Website link is in #üìöÔ∏±verified-links


[2/16/2024 12:08 PM] antonb
stETH is on Ethereum mainnetm but MOR token and liquidity will be on Arbitrum


[2/16/2024 12:12 PM] wefet
Is Morpheus similar to the idea of Chain Abstraction, which users can interact with different chain with a single interface?


[2/16/2024 12:14 PM] antonb
Morpheus is chain agnostic, projects would connect with Morpheus rather than be built on the Morpheus network


[2/16/2024 12:15 PM] sneakysquidnoob
how do i get stETH? Sorry but I am a newbie. It seems like on metamask wallet is allowed?


[2/16/2024 12:16 PM] antonb
You can obtain it by direct staking ETH on Lido or buy on exchanges. This and other answers you might found helpful are available in the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

did you send me a pm?

On Lido you stake your ETH and receive stETH that you can deposit into Morpheus contract


[2/16/2024 1:58 PM] antonb
Swap likely will be much more expensive


[2/16/2024 1:58 PM] antonb

so after i connect walllet, stake my eth to get steth, i will have steth in my wallet immediately?


[2/16/2024 2:05 PM] sneakysquidnoob
and i can use that steth to stake in morpheus? to get mor?


[2/16/2024 2:07 PM] antonb
If we are talking about Lido, you'll get stETH after confirmation of your tx.


[2/16/2024 2:07 PM] sneakysquidnoob
yes lido


[2/16/2024 2:07 PM] antonb
Correct


[2/16/2024 2:12 PM] sneakysquidnoob
so after 8 may, mor tokens will be like any other tokens, i can sell or buy them? but buy or sell where?


[2/16/2024 2:13 PM] antonb
üì¢ Beware of scammers! 
As some fellas reported scam attempts recently, here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lost their funds:

Accelerators would never DM you with any links.
All the official links are available in #üìöÔ∏±verified-links 

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO private token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

AI Overlord bless you ü§ñ

just thinking how to safeguard myself a bit more before i stake


[2/16/2024 2:34 PM] sneakysquidnoob
shd i create a new wallet at metamask just for this?


[2/16/2024 2:34 PM] sneakysquidnoob
how do i withdraw later? must it be the same wallet?


[2/16/2024 2:35 PM] antonb
This is one of the good cybersec practices


[2/16/2024 2:37 PM] antonb
AFAIK, there were suggestions to be able to withdraw to the different wallet, but they haven't been implemented yet. I'd recommenr to presume that you will claim to the same wallet you deposited from.


[2/16/2024 2:39 PM] sneakysquidnoob
so just to understand more, if i ever get free stuffs, i shd not open them otherwise risk getting drained of my funds and tokens right? i have read too many people falling prey to scammers on X by clicking links and in the next 5mins everything is gone


[2/16/2024 2:40 PM] 9t8t8
Is there any video tutorial on how to stake steth and get $mor


[2/16/2024 2:40 PM] antonb
You won't be drained just click the link, but only when you sign approval tx to malicious contract.


[2/16/2024 2:40 PM] antonb
But yeah, better not click üôÇ


[2/16/2024 2:41 PM] sneakysquidnoob
so how will i know when a link is actually the official link? and not a scammer etc... only click links from official website? what if the scammer made a website similar to the official and as newbie I cant tell? üò¶


[2/16/2024 2:42 PM] antonb
Hi. Not that I aware of as the process is pretty straightforward. Connect your wallet, sign approval tx and after sign stake tx. That's all.


[2/16/2024 2:42 PM] 9t8t8
Aight I‚Äôve never used arb


[2/16/2024 2:43 PM] antonb
And you don't need to, as stETH deposits are on Ethereum mainnet.


[2/16/2024 2:44 PM] antonb
Arbitrum is utilized for MOR token and AMM liquidity


[2/16/2024 2:44 PM] 9t8t8
Oh so I just need to stake regualr eth and then use it on the fairlaunch site?


[2/16/2024 2:44 PM] antonb
Double check with official sources


[2/16/2024 2:45 PM] antonb
Also some wallets, like Rabby and cybersecurity browser extensions provide additional layer of protection.


[2/16/2024 2:48 PM] antonb
First you need to obtain stETH which is staked in Lido Ethereum. You can do it directly on Lido (link is in #üìöÔ∏±verified-links) or buy on DEX/CEX.
When you have stETH of the Ethereum mainnet, you can deposit it through the Morpheus website.

[2/16/2024 2:57 PM] antonb
Note, that you'll need to sign 2 txs, first one for approval and secon for staking.


[2/16/2024 2:59 PM] 9t8t8
Yeah I did both


[2/16/2024 3:00 PM] 9t8t8

[2/16/2024 3:00 PM] 9t8t8
Like how much steth for 1 mor coin


[2/16/2024 3:00 PM] sneakysquidnoob
can i just check, if i have 2 wallets in metamask, even if 1 wallet gets compromise, will the other wallet get affect? Since it is 2 account in the same wallet?


[2/16/2024 3:01 PM] antonb
Some napkin math is here

[2/16/2024 3:03 PM] antonb
It depends on the type of the attack. If someone steal your seed phrase leak, you'll lost all your funds, if two wallets created under one account.
If you give approval to a drainer, only one address will be affected.


[2/16/2024 3:05 PM] 9t8t8

[2/16/2024 3:12 PM] antonb
Yes, if it connects to the drainer contract approval.


[2/16/2024 3:14 PM] antonb
But there are ways where you can be attacked by other vectors just joining malicious website)
Don't wanna scare you, but I've been a strategic advisor for one of the famous crypto cybersec company and can say that anything can be hacked, the only question is the price of the hack.

[2/16/2024 5:23 PM] antonb
Welcome !


[2/16/2024 5:25 PM] janitor4826
Can I stake my stETH now? How to calculate the duration? If I stake NOW, then my fund withdraw date should be 2024/2/23, is that correct?


[2/16/2024 5:27 PM] janitor4826
also I wanna ask, If I stake longer than the other, will I get more $MOR? or the token reward is just related to the fund amount that I staked, nomatter what duration I staked??


[2/16/2024 5:28 PM] antonb
Yes, you can stake now.
There is no limit on how long to stake. You will be able to withdraw your stETH 7 days after deposit.


[2/16/2024 5:29 PM] antonb
You earn MOR while you contribute yield, i.e. your stETH are in the contract.


[2/16/2024 5:30 PM] janitor4826
so the end time of the fairlaunch is feb 15 to all stakers? or it depends on which date I stake?


[2/16/2024 5:30 PM] antonb

Mor rewards kinda decreased when I deposited more stETH.  It went from 1.2 MOR to 0.2 after adding stETH.  Could be just UI bug but just wanted to report it


[2/16/2024 7:50 PM] antonb
May I know the amount you deposited to verify if everything is correct?


[2/16/2024 7:54 PM] shitwascash
So after bootstrap period.  What exactly is done with the steth yield from capital providers from there?


[2/16/2024 7:55 PM] antonb
It's paired with 51444 MOR dedicated for liquidity and added to Arbitrum Uniswap


[2/16/2024 7:56 PM] dugdisc
I deposited 1.5 stETH on Sunday 9pm pst. And now I added 0.68 stETH. Rewards went from 1.2 mor to 0.2.  Blockchain might have right amount but UI display might be buggy


[2/16/2024 7:56 PM] shitwascash
After bootstrap and that initial 51444, what is done with all further yield?


[2/16/2024 7:57 PM] shitwascash
It is possible you deposited on a different address? I deposited a new deposit recently and my MOR remained the same and went up faster

{Reactions}
üëçüèæ 

[2/16/2024 7:57 PM] antonb
and after this, periodically 50% of yield will be used to buy MOR from the AMM, pair with remain 50% and again add to AMM, thus creating buy pressure and ever growing liquidity.


[2/16/2024 7:59 PM] antonb
This could be due to increase in deposits that dilutes share of everyone, but increase MOR in value, so in fact you don't lose anything.
Here is the calculator of stETH rewards

I hope it would address your query üôÇ


[2/16/2024 8:03 PM] dugdisc
I‚Äôm thinking UI calculated based on current staked compared to February 11 when I initially deposited the stETH.  So value stayed the same.  1.2 mor back in February 11 is now worth 0.2 currently due to increased staked


[2/16/2024 8:06 PM] antonb
What the indicator do you imply in your message?


[2/16/2024 8:08 PM] dugdisc
1.2 mor back in February 11 is equal to 0.2 mor value right now. Same value when it comes to dollar amount


[2/16/2024 8:08 PM] antonb
Okay, I see, but where did you get these figures from?


[2/16/2024 8:10 PM] dugdisc
I didn‚Äôt calculate it.. I‚Äôm just throwing out reasons why ui amount went down.


[2/16/2024 8:11 PM] antonb
I might misunderstood you. Yeah, that's correct there is correlation between amount of MOR rewards and $ value.


[2/16/2024 8:11 PM] dugdisc
It was 44000 when I initially deposited and 67000 when I added stETH.. average numbers not exact count

In fact the Capital Provider reward in Morpheus goes for the entire **~16 year period** of the initial supply curve.
Wow, why that long, 16 years of staking reward campaign?


[2/16/2024 10:34 PM] antonb
And this is only first epoch, followed by 240 years of the tails emissions.

[2/16/2024 10:51 PM] _ericcart
hey im a newbie here
just a quick question
only capital providers & code providers can claim their $MOR token after May 9th, while compute providers cannot because the compute contract will be live in May and they haven't start their emission process though they are allocated a certain amount of $MOR token from the beginning


[2/16/2024 10:51 PM] _ericcart
do i understand it right?


[2/16/2024 10:53 PM] antonb
Warm welcome! 
The only correction is that Compute and App builders emissions started the same moment as Compute and Code and will be stored in the contract until corresponding contracts are up and running.

# Friday Status Update:

Happy Friday! The Morpheus community continues to grow. The Capital Provider Smart Contract is approaching 4,000 transactions. With the average person each adding a single deposit transaction, this metric is a good rough proxy for how many people have joined the Morpheus community the first 9 days of the fair launch. 

After the withdraw function went live on day 7, there was a significant increase in stETH deposits and generally the inflows of stETH continued to outpace withdraws ever since.

The community has generated a lot of cool websites and resources to look at all the data and stats from the Morpheus fair launch. Highlighting a couple of the best links here.

After the bootstrapping period. What, if any, changes will be made to the contracts holding the steth?

Good question. Before I answer it, may I know what kind of changes you think about?

[2/17/2024 4:01 PM] antonb
In general, there are a few aspects:
1. The contract is managed by 4/7 multisig, so one person can't make any changes.
2. Due to the open source nature of Morpheus, all the proposed ideas, suggestions and possible changes are public, transparent and go through community discussion, so there is no way something that would have impact to the whole ecosystem can be suddenly changed.
3. Contracts went through 4 tiers of audits. Any change in basic logic likely would need another audit.
4. Trust of community is on of the biggest values for Morpheus.

That's correct. Currently node is the local LLM, that evolves from release to release to the full Node. Current version is 0.0.5, but you can also check 0.0.6 https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/tree/0.0.6-beta that is  still being tested.

But I was asking more of, is there a guarantee that I will not lose my stETH?


[2/18/2024 2:12 AM] antonb
There are always risk related to the smart contracts.
To ensure the highest possible security level, there is multisignature 4/7 in place and the Contract went through 4 tiers of audits.

what will be the price settings in the pool? (MOR launch price)


[2/18/2024 4:45 AM] antonb
It depends on the stETH yield that will be accumulated during bootstrapping period.


[2/18/2024 4:55 AM] chichi33
so it will be 1:1


[2/18/2024 4:57 AM] antonb
It won't be 1:1. From the one side there will be X stETH yield and ~51000 MOR from the other.


[2/18/2024 4:58 AM] chichi33
stTH yield accumulated to 4% of MOR from protection allocation?


[2/18/2024 4:58 AM] antonb

[2/18/2024 6:39 AM] smartagents
Trolling ?

That's not really how the math works.
In Morpheus every additional stETH deposited adds more demand for MOR.

It doesn't matter if 100 stETH, 10,000 stETH or 100,000 get deposited. Its proportionally more demand for MOR.


[2/18/2024 6:40 AM] drpastet89
Exactly. So if the new demand wanting to enter the staking is not allowed to do so they will fomo and buy from secondary and pump the price more


[2/18/2024 6:41 AM] smartagents
Try reading the white paper friend. There will be no limits imposed against everyone's free and equal access to provide Capital. Its a key part of the design. The liquidity will continue to flow. It helps everyone providing Code, Compute and Community Frontends. You should want tens and then hundreds of thousands of people to provide stETH. Its how the Network effect gets built.


[2/18/2024 6:41 AM] rozh92
@SmartAgents i staked some steth but my portion stays at 0% will this change after a few hours or ?


[2/18/2024 6:43 AM] smartagents
You should see an absolute number of MOR earned. The percentage display doesn't matter. It just shows zero if the decimal place of the stETH is below 0.01% of the total.


[2/18/2024 6:47 AM] rozh92
Oke understood thank you yeah i have staked 100 bucks just to test the waters.

@SmartAgents are you guys planning on selling nodes like etcmc or miners ? Or is it just installing nodes on your pc ?


[2/18/2024 7:01 AM] dugdisc
It don't matter if more people stake stETH because the price of MOR increases.  If price per MOR is $1 and you get 1 MOR = $1 daily.  Price pumps to $100 per MOR cos more people staked and you get 0.01 MOR = $1 daily.  It don't matter if more stETH are staked, what matters is how much stETH you put in.  So I would blame myself if I'm not getting more MOR rewards.

what's the reason for this warning message from Metamask when we try to deposit steth 
"Custom spending cap
115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457.584007913129639935
This allows the third party to spend stETH from your current balance."
I know all deposits were done without any problems but resolving whatever the reason is that triggers this warning would make this process more comfortable (less suspicious) for new entrants.


[2/18/2024 10:03 AM] smartagents
I'm not aware of a way to resolve the error. Its a generalized warning that is alerting users that the purpose of the Approval is indeed to allow the third party (in this case the Morpheus Smart Contract) to spend stETH from your current balance.


[2/18/2024 10:04 AM] smartagents
That is required for the contribution of the daily stETH rebase reward to be added to the Morpheus Protocol Owned Liquidity.

gm guys! is it corrrect to say that Morpheus is a network of AIs ‚Äì¬†AKA Smart Agents ‚Äì offering agentic services for all kind of purposes by executing smart contracts on behalf of users? & they'll be the one interacting w/ user's web3 wallet and signing their transactions?


[2/18/2024 2:33 PM] antonb
Yes, this is one of the Morpheus` definitions.
The only correction, is that Smart Agents won't be signing txs, but will take care of everything before you click SEND tx button.


[2/18/2024 2:43 PM] cosineavogrado
thanks! 

also, 'Developers pay MOR to compute providers for functions beyond what local hardware can execute" this was in the docs. Is this on top of the 24% that compute providers receive?


[2/18/2024 2:45 PM] antonb
Yes, that's the fee paid by users or app devs if they need additional compute above their daily access rate or they don't have enough local resources


[2/18/2024 3:22 PM] cosineavogrado
icic! are there any guide/info on how to become a compute provider? like the requirements & steps etc..

ohhh icic, so the only thing i can prepare right now is to set up a node?


[2/18/2024 4:17 PM] antonb
Currently the node is the local LLM and will become full Node  before the Compute contract is up and running.


[2/18/2024 5:30 PM] roccobarocco73
Hi - what type of hardware will be required to provide Compute to the Morpheus network?


[2/18/2024 5:37 PM] antonb
Hello! It's also is in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**How can I run the node? **
You need a Mac or PC with Linux Debian with 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core, this a minimum requirement to ensure that there will be no issue on the system side and run most LLMs, follow steps from the guides located in the readme on Github.

Hi. Morpheus is solely open source project, which implies there is no formal team, founders, registered company or foundation.

hey, Im looking at technical specifications for Macs, and for memory they state, for example, 32 GB unified memory.  Would this be suitable to provide compute?


[2/18/2024 6:18 PM] antonb
I'm not the owner of Mac, but from my knowledge, Macs don‚Äôt have vRAM, but it shared via unified memory.


[2/18/2024 6:19 PM] antonb
So it should suite if there is no other large memory consuming apps running.

As the community grows quickly, please be careful of scammers! 
As some folks reported scam attempts recently. 
Here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lose your funds:

Accelerators will never DM you with any links.
All the real links are available in #üìöÔ∏±verified-links  channel. 

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO private token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

Yield is actually what you give to Morpheus (your principal stays with you) and get MOR tokens as reward. 
Morpheus uses yield generated by stETH for creating Protocol owned Liquidity.


[2/18/2024 9:59 PM] sneakysquidnoob
oh ok... so when the 90 days is over... i can get back my steth or leave it, but get mor tokens to buy sell or use right?


[2/18/2024 10:02 PM] antonb
You can withdraw your stETH 7 days after the deposit and on day 90, MOR token becomes claimable/sendable/tradable.
If you decide to leave stETh in the contract after the bootstrapping, it will continue to generate you rewards.


[2/18/2024 10:03 PM] sneakysquidnoob
so is it going to give higher stake % then leaving it as steth in lido?


[2/18/2024 10:03 PM] shredder_gaming
Im putting my money on Morpheus and SingularityNET (not really decentralised but Ben has the right attitude towards AI). I just hope this project is not a scam because if it is not hands down it will be amazing. However I have been in at least 6 coins that promised the world and collapsed or disappeared. With no word from the team or a sorry.

You don't need to hope, it's everything transparent and onchain.
Three anonymous people you mentioned sent to community a document describing Morpheus and that moment became the beginning of what Morpheus is now.
There is no team, no founders, but 150+ opensource Code contributors and 3000+ Capital providers.
Morpheus has been launched in fair way, where everyone had the same conditions and opportunity. There are no premine, private allocations, VCs onboard, etc.

So quick question: the staked seth you can claim after the 90 days period and still get your MOR as well ?

You can claim any time over 256 years after initial 7 days lockup. 
After 90 days of the bootstrapping period MOR token will become claimable.

[2/19/2024 12:55 AM] antonb
That's correct


[2/19/2024 12:56 AM] terminidis9305
What will be first day circulation supply


[2/19/2024 12:56 AM] terminidis9305
1/5?


[2/19/2024 12:56 AM] terminidis9305
Around 8 million

Yes sorry


[2/19/2024 12:57 AM] terminidis9305
Can you answer please?


[2/19/2024 12:58 AM] antonb
This information is available by the link I provided you above.
Rough estimate of the potentially claimable tokens on the 1st day is 620k MOR

Thanks üôè


[2/19/2024 1:00 AM] terminidis9305
Let's say that I invest 2k usd, what I will expect to receive every day?


[2/19/2024 1:00 AM] antonb
But actual circ supply will depend on the amount of claimed tokens.

What is that in USD?


[2/19/2024 1:26 AM] antonb
Can't say, but can calculate.
For example, if you see that with 30 gwei it's $150, with 15gwei it will be ~75$

So if there are around 4000 wallets contributing that means the min. average Eth being staked is $75,000. Are you guys for real? I am playing in a whales playground? Or is there a couple of big whales and the rest are say an average of 10K?

That is just a silly response. I have been in crypto for 5 years I am not into this quick gains scenarios. What I am pointing out is that At the moment i see some whales accumulating and I wonder how this will effect this coin just after launch to the market, once your normal plebs buy in. I am just curious, no need to get all toxic


[2/19/2024 6:11 AM] kruztys
i mean its obvious the token should dump on launch unless demand exceeds supply greatly. but the point of the eth staking isnt for token price its for protocol growth they shouldnt care about pa at launch and whatever happens happens


[2/19/2024 6:17 AM] kruztys
yea cuz ur prob not a whale


[2/19/2024 6:17 AM] hexmaster
i mean that's subjective now ain't it?

Actually on fair launch date, would there tokens from the code providers in the market as well?


[2/19/2024 6:29 AM] tigerbuidl.
the tokens that are given out are distributed among code and capital providers


[2/19/2024 6:33 AM] cattaput123
But the initial lo pool would be the 51k MOR tokens - steth?

One application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding.

Right now ethereum's biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing.

Can any mod answer


[2/19/2024 10:25 AM] mahalleinirx
Correct, if the approver is corrupt then with Atomic Governance that can happen, however, there are best practises in place to help prevent this


[2/19/2024 10:27 AM] mahalleinirx
This is the same in any project, company or DAO though and often I find the latter corrupted

Is just sometimes in companies there are bad eggs too, not everyone there

If people don't think the repo owner is acting accordingly they can fork the code and conduct it in a different way but I believe in the repo owners intentions here to make everything as fair as possible

Would suggest starting here and looking at TCM for more about atomic governance and best practises for code contribution


[2/19/2024 10:50 AM] cattaput123
The capital providers could decide to direct our steth staking rewards to diff projects? Do we get to choose in future?


[2/19/2024 10:52 AM] cattaput123
And won‚Äôt there still be a Repo Owner who approves the code and rewards the coders for their work? Who would that be? It‚Äôs not clear


[2/19/2024 10:53 AM] mahalleinirx
The capital providers currently can not do that but possibly in the future there will be more projects on TCM and people can direct yield to bootstrap those projects as well


[2/19/2024 10:54 AM] mahalleinirx
Would be whomever decides to fork the repo, for the speed developments needs it works better if it is not slowed down by something like a vote on a DAO


[2/19/2024 10:54 AM] mahalleinirx
I am sure over time there will be better measures in place but this is the first project to use this process


[2/19/2024 10:54 AM] cattaput123
This isn‚Äôt like a Dao where it‚Äôs only a Yes/No right? Like different capital providers can choose to fund diff projects, so a few proj can happen simultaneously


[2/19/2024 10:59 AM] cattaput123
Wdym?


[2/19/2024 11:05 AM] mahalleinirx

Thanks for the answer. How are rewards calculated?


[2/19/2024 5:30 PM] antonb
MOR emissions happen every block and spread among Capital Providers based on their share in the total stETH deposited pool.


[2/19/2024 5:47 PM] .drspartacus85
Hey guys, do I understand it right that I get my steth back after the 90 days?


[2/19/2024 6:01 PM] antonb
You can withdraw your stETH any time 7 days after deposit.


[2/19/2024 6:04 PM] antonb
Please give a read to #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs where all the most frequent questions are covered


[2/19/2024 6:33 PM] .drspartacus85
Ok thank you. I read it now. So there is no exchange steth into mor. The liquidity for mor is created by the yield from the steth


[2/19/2024 6:34 PM] .drspartacus85
and i can decide how long I want to contribute with my steh. Even it goes over the period of 90 days. Is correct summerized?


[2/19/2024 6:41 PM] antonb
That's it and users who provide stETH are being rewarded in MOR tokens in pro rata to their share.

Yes, it's fully up to you to decide when to withdraw. MOR emissions will be there for 256 years

hi. If I deposit ETH now, when will I receive tokens? On May 8th or 91 days from today's date?


[2/19/2024 8:04 PM] antonb
GM. If you deposit stETH (not ETH) on Ethereum mainnet today, you'll be able to claim your rewards on May 8th

Is it possible for this to be multichain so blockchains such as Cardano, Polk, etc can stake their tokens also not just Ethereum, it seems like it is limiting its potential.


[2/19/2024 8:12 PM] shredder_gaming
Also the gas fees on Eth are terrible still


[2/19/2024 8:14 PM] antonb
Morpheus is chain agnostic and can be multichain. There are plans for the future to add more yield generation assets from other chains for Phase 4

They position as L1 PoW chain, when Morpheus isn't chain. They have nothing in common.


[2/19/2024 8:37 PM] shredder_gaming
ohh, what exactly is morpheus then? Sorry still trying to make sense of exactly what all these different AI projects do


[2/19/2024 8:39 PM] antonb
Morpheus is web3 infrastructure for powering different types of AI, including Smart Agents, general purpose AIs that connect with your wallet and can interact with smart contracts on your behalf.
Think of Morpheus as appstore, but decentralized, with no fee and for AI.

I just tried depositing stETH, gas was $20, + the transaction failed...now I've lost $20 ETH in gas fees...can I get it back?...or is there a cheaper way to deposit $ here?


[2/19/2024 8:52 PM] shredder_gaming
no just do it again


[2/19/2024 8:53 PM] shredder_gaming
everytime i did it, i just did it twice but it charges you only a small amount second time


[2/19/2024 8:53 PM] shredder_gaming
I presume because it goes via Lido.binance then morpheus.....not sure how to track it


[2/19/2024 8:54 PM] shredder_gaming
But i though the same thing but it was not lost just seems like 2 stages.............im not pro though on metamask

It usually happens due to specifics of MM fee calculation, try to increase gas limit

There are 2 tx, first one to approve amount and second send stETH to the contract.


[2/19/2024 8:56 PM] genxzero
Thanks for yoru help! Meanwhile, I just tried again + even though I have a few more $ than the gas in ETH, it's rejecting my transaction for not having enough ETH...so now I have to buy more ETH, + pay more fees just to get the possibility of the lower 2nd transaction you've described...argh


[2/19/2024 8:57 PM] antonb
Another way to "save" is to wait for lower gas price


[2/19/2024 8:57 PM] genxzero
Thanks....yes, that's what I've experienced previously, but not now...but I'll try your suggestion re MM...

Yea i dislike most things ETH, I am an ADA Maxi but sometimes i have to endure the money thief to get to good projects. In saying that I still hold ETH and think it is amazing but the transaction fees are rediculous. I read the instructions which said make sure to have enough ETH to cover transactions

[2/19/2024 9:29 PM] antonb
Hi there. There is a concept behind depositing called Techno Capital Machine, pioneering by Morpheus. 

Users provide capital in form of stETH, Morpheus uses yield generated for protocol owned liquidity creation, users be rewarded in MOR token pro rata to their share in the total deposited pool. 
To be clear, principal is always yours, protocol only gets yield generated by stETH.

Currently we are in 90 days initial bootstrapping phase where initial liquidity for AMM are being accumulated.

After 90 days, protocol will periodically use 50% of the yield to buy MOR tokens from the AMM and add them to LP after pairing with the remaining 50% on the yield.

Token as it's not live yet. Morpheus has launched on Feb 8th. Currently we are in bootstrapping period and you can earn MOR by contributing either Capital (stETH) or Code and claim your rewards on 8th of May.

Please refer to #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs  and if anything is still unclear, feel free to ask.

Hi guys, am I too late to the party to start staking now? I don‚Äôt have a lot of funds, so I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs even worth it.


[2/20/2024 12:20 AM] swayjullz
Since rewards are based on the amount of steth staking as far as I understand


[2/20/2024 12:20 AM] antonb
You are early, actually. All you need to know for start are in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs


[2/20/2024 12:22 AM] antonb
Deposits are in stETH on the Ethereum mainnet. You are getting rewards according to your share in the total stETH deposited pool.


[2/20/2024 12:23 AM] antonb
At the moment here 80k+ stETH are in the contract


[2/20/2024 12:24 AM] swayjullz
Thanks for the info! Btw, are transaction costs still a pain in the ass on eth or they are more reasonable atm? I have been out of the game for quite some time and I‚Äôm just getting into it.


[2/20/2024 12:26 AM] antonb
It heavily depends on the gas price. I personally paid ~$60, but there are mates who managed to pay only $12


[2/20/2024 12:27 AM] antonb
I'd recommend using Rabby wallet it has better fee calculation

No, you can't as token doesn't exist.
There are two ways you can earn it before claiming, you can provide either code to the Morpheus GitHub or Capital in form of stETH.

I made a pull request to code contributions a while back but it‚Äôs still sitting as open. Meanwhile, quite a few others have been accepted already, including some created after I made my one. What‚Äôs the normal time for approving such requests and distributing MOR? Would be good to just have a bit more transparency on waiting time for contributions so that community members like myself can have some confidence that if they make a meaningful contribution, it will be fairly rewarded. Or if not, it will receive some feedback if it‚Äôs going to be rejected.

Guys, I'm sure there are significant reasons why your PRs haven't merged. I'd wait for @SmartAgents responce before jump intp conclusions.

[2/20/2024 11:35 PM] smartagents
This is a good question. I and @Maxwell_Smart_Agent are reviewing Pull Requests as we can between other work.
Though to scale it will help to have others involved in this. The best practices list mentions rewards for those conducting reviews of code. So having more reviewers will be important decentralize this aspect.


[2/20/2024 11:36 PM] smartagents
Want to get approved fast. Communicate directly with the Github maintainer. I also spend a lot of time telling people they aren't putting their PR in the correct repository or it doesn't meet the best practices.

{Reactions}
ü´° 

[2/20/2024 11:37 PM] smartagents
This will improve. I know @Maxwell_Smart_Agent is putting together a nice interface to make developers on boarding a lot smoother, so we can move past this manual process.


[2/20/2024 11:47 PM] joe_ai
Got it. Yeah definitely some process improvements to be made there but can totally understand lots of other stuff going on. Just checked the best practices document and it states that the contributor should message the repository owner before doing work if that work is substantial. So is that you @SmartAgents ? And is it best to message on Discord for this pre-approval?


[2/20/2024 11:50 PM] smartagents
Yes. That would be great. Message me on the Coding channel please.
Also please note that devs have reorganized the Repos so that everything isn't all in one giant repository anymore.
There is now a dedicated Docs repo for example where people should be updating their Code Contributions.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs
I only see 2 Pull Request there, so I'll go back and check the old repo where there are 20 Pull Requests in the wrong spot : )

You can compare Morpheus with Bitcoin, no formal team, no founders, no company, no foundation, but 150+ contributors to open source code and 3200+ capital providers. Morpheus is solely community driven and owned.

On Feb 8th project has been launched in fair way, which means equal conditions and opportunity for everyone. No premine, to team tokens, no allocations, no fundraising rounds.

There are no people you can speak to about listing, if you want to list, please do that after the token is live of May 8th.

Hi friends! 

I created a dune dashboard (https://dune.com/binarybuddha/morpheus-fair-launch)

It gives you a quick overview how much stETH has been staked in Capital Provider sc and other metrics (num of stakers, daily stETH staked etc-)

Let me know if you guys are looking for other metrics I'll pull those data on add it to the dashboard.

One of the wallet addresses ( 0xfe17147301888fBEEc36be3a8e6E4f883496ed33) got approved for a total of 1,860 hours. This contributor called "Anon 33" has had the highest number of hours approved over any other contributor. 

And in the description of their work, all it says is "Anon 33 Contribution to papers, reviews, and code."

Why was this approved with such a vague description? 

And can we get more transparency on what the actual work done here to warrant such an approval?

I reckon this is legit ask, but would you be so kind to move it to #‚ö°Ô∏±code-providers to be sure that @SmartAgents  will notice it and give an answer when he is online?

I created that space,  thinking it could be valuable for the Morpheus community but don‚Äôt really have the bandwidth to manage it, but if you or somebody else wants to lead that, DM me and I can transfer the admin. It works best when there are designated leads/reviewers for the different projects happening in Morpheus. so whoever those are, would ideally need to get those onboard too. Although I know some folks wanted to build out an open source version, but guess that‚Äôs gonna take a while‚Ä¶

I asked ChatGPT to rewrite that but make it extremely verbose, result is kinda cool:

"Morpheus, an entity whose inherent disposition is distinctly characterized by an unwavering sense of optimism, consistently and persistently serves as a purveyor of uplifting encouragement, thereby emerging as a prominent and inspirational beacon within the shared consciousness of the collective. Demonstrating an ardent and unwavering commitment to the overarching ethos encapsulated by e/acc (acceleration), Morpheus fervently undertakes the role of a spirited and zealous catalyst, rallying and inspiring individuals hailing from diverse walks of life to converge harmoniously in a unified pursuit. This collective undertaking, none other than the endeavor of the highest order, involves the collaborative construction of the imminent and impending future, wherein the amalgamation of visionary perspectives, impassioned dedication, and unyielding determination operates synergistically as the propulsive force steering humanity towards unprecedented echelons of achievement, progress, and unparalleled heights of collective ascendancy.

[2/22/2024 11:16 AM] smartagents
Not yet. Compute Providers start in Phase 2 post May 8th.

how to become conpute providers


[2/22/2024 11:17 AM] smartagents
Best thing to do if you have GPUs is to join the network such as Akash and when Morpheus Compute Rewards go live to direct the API endpoints to offer Inference to Morpheus Smart Agents.


[2/22/2024 4:11 PM] within4d45
Hey everyone! I am wondering about the different phases of the token launch
Will they be running at parallel or will stETH distribution stop once the Compute phase goes live?


[2/22/2024 4:12 PM] within4d45
And am I right in believing that right now only the ETH staking will provide MOR, so when the token launches, only 3456*90ish tokens will be in circulation?


[2/22/2024 4:24 PM] antonb
Hi. They will be run one by one and complement each other. Think of it like pieces of a puzzle.


[2/22/2024 4:26 PM] antonb
On May 8th there will be ~640k  MOR available for claim by Capital and Morpheus Code  providers

Hi,
I was wondering when I went to the Morpheus website at
https://mor.org/
The about page came with a 404 error. Is there any work being done to correct this. Doesn't give the best impression for new users when they first see the site.

They will get only MOR emissions dedicated to them.

ah your number was the total amount that was being collected for those two groups until then


[2/22/2024 8:54 PM] antonb
Correct, the whole amount that will be emitted on Day 90 is around ~1,28mln MOR, but as Compute and Community app builders contracts are not live yet, their rewards can not be claimed and will be stored in the distribution contract.

**Tl;dr A personal AI connected to a Web3 wallet that can use Smart Contracts.**


[2/23/2024 2:31 AM] smartagents
## Longer Description From the SmartAgent white paper:
"Smart Agent is a term to describe a general purpose AI that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user. This is achieved by connecting four key pieces.

1. The user‚Äôs Web3 wallet for key management & to sign recommended transactions when interacting with the Smart Agent.
2. A Large Language Model trained on Web3 data including Blockchains, Wallets, Dapps, DAOs, & Smart Contracts.
3. The SmartContractRank algorithm to score & recommend the best Smart Contracts to the user.
4. Longterm memory of user data & connected applications stored locally or via decentralized cloud to provide broader context to Smart Agent actions.

The concept is for the Smart Agent to be an extension of you. It acts according to your instructions, leverages your wallet & data to benefit you. Your Smart Agent is controlled by your Web3 private keys as you authorize actions for it to take."

As I understand that, there will be marketplace with different apps/agents you can buy/use according to your needs.

# Coders Dashboard at Mor.Software
Website: https://mor.software/

Big thanks to @Maxwell_Smart_Agent for building a Coders Dashboard for the developer community to use.

This will make it a lot easier for Developers who want to get involved in providing Code Contributions to Morpheus.
Just click the "Register as a Developer" button, then input your Github handle and Ethereum address and other info and the Dashboard will create you a "MOR DEV ID". These DEV IDs will be included in pull requests related to Code Contributions starting in the March snapshot of Code Contributors. 

The Dashboard will also start connecting in Issues and existing known Coding needs so it makes it easier for devs to find what needs to be worked on next. Later it the Dashboard will provide a way for Devs to check their weights recorded in the monthly Coding snapshots and the resulting MOR they have earned and can be claimed at their address. 

## Code Contributor Guide To Earning Weights & Their Implied Value
In a related effort to make it easier for developers to understand how to bid on providing code and the value of the coding "weights" they earn and how that translates into MOR tokens I've written this guide and added it to Github.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/English%20Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md

One change worth noting is that the term "hours" proved very confusing as it was meant as proxy for weights / value contributed to the Coding Contributions not literal hours. So hours as a term has been replaced by "weights". Hopefully the guide will make it clear on how to think about the potential value of these weights and how that is determined by the free market based on the amount of stETH contributed and after May 8th the free market price of MOR / wETH.

Morpheus builds not by a company that needs funding, but a community of open source developers.
There are four main groups of contributors, they are:
- Community app builders
- Compute providers
- Code providers
- Capital Providers
The latest category ensures liquidity for the other three.

Morpheus: The Open Source Network for AI Smart Agents
David A. Johnston is an open source contributor at Morpheus.

In this episode, we spotlight the open source network for AI smart agents--Morpheus. David believes Morpheus offers the best solution to the legacy issues crypto faces with UI/UX. With Morpheus, the average user someday will be able to type in normal language and have AI take complex ...

I was trying to test out mprheus AI ona borrowed machine it had an nvidia gtx1060 gpu (6GB - does not meet min req) and a core i5 with 16 gigs ram morpheus installed fine on debian but when it started I always got ollama errors something about some connection denied. Is this normal is some firewall or something blocking ollama initialisation or is my hardware blocking ollama. It looked like a software end issue

Oh ok because when I navigated to the ollama binary directly and ran it as non root it would run but without any config I guess that morpbheus would be doing. Thanks.


[2/23/2024 1:36 PM] antonb
One community member suggested this solution. Would you be able to try?
`/usr/lib/morpheus/resources/app/src/service/ollama/runners/ollama-linux$ ./ollama serve`


[2/23/2024 1:37 PM] antonb
you just have to run this before entering the morpheus command


[2/23/2024 1:38 PM] kvnodes0
ok I had tried that in a vm and ollama had run. Did the community member say if ollama serve needed to be run  as root or if the user priviledges are fine?

Hi there. What do you exactly mean?


[2/23/2024 8:03 PM] antonb

[2/23/2024 8:28 PM] within4d45
I don't think that's a valid conclusion. 
Nobody knows how the turnout would be with other liquid staking providers or just offering native ETH to be staked on the platform that the protocol then stakes itself

So far it works well. stETH is just only beginning, there are plans to accept multiple yield generated assets on different chains to ensure sufficient liquidity for growing Morpheus ecosystem.

You can't buy MOR token until May 8th. There only way is to earn it by providing Capital in form of stETH or Code to the Morpheus Github. #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs is the best place to start your journey with Morpheus from üôÇ


[2/23/2024 9:28 PM] thedarkside.eth
i wa trying to send in a screenshot but wont let me here. 

Basically it's asking for a Custom Spending Cap. then it states in fine print.
THIS ALLOWS THE THIRD PART TO SPEND xxxxx AMOUNT OF STETH FROM YOUR CURRENT BALANCE. 

I doubled check and it is the legit website.


[2/23/2024 9:28 PM] thedarkside.eth
But Yes when you approve the STETH amount.


[2/23/2024 9:31 PM] antonb
If you interact with the website by the link provided in #üìöÔ∏±verified-links . then it's a standart approval procedure. You can enter exact the same amount you want to deposit or bigger one, if you will deposit more later, so you don't need sign approval and pay fee again next time.

Definitely lots of DeGens out there that are going to prefer holding other LSTs a la Eigenlayer as and when available. Important I think for ETH holders themselves though to decide on the LST given different risk exposures. But I assume if alternatives to stETH were added in the future, it would require the Morpheus multisig to amend the distribution contract and they'd need to agree on allocation %s.

Do we have any plan to coordinate with other project? XEN is launching their blockchain soon and they have some computational power , maybe morpheus can make some good use from them.


[2/24/2024 8:44 PM] antonb
Hey, and thanks for the suggestion. It would be easier to understand Morpheus concept if you replace Morpheus to Bitcoin. 
Can Bitcoin coordinate with XEN? I doubt. 
Can XEN build something upon Bitcoin? They can.
Is there a Bitcoin team? No.
Are there passionate people in Bitcoin who run it forward? Yes, they are opensource contributors.


[2/24/2024 8:50 PM] antonb
Put it differently, if XEN or any other projects see benefits for them in using Morpheus, there are contributors to guide and support them. Morpheus doesn't have dedicated marketing or BD team as well as budgets for promo, PR and collabs. 
Morpheus is what the community makes him. If you have any connections that potentially can benefit Morpheus and therefore each of its members and can bring these connections here, that would be great.

@antonb | will not DM you another good tip for the community call, make a separate channel called something like ‚Äúgov-call-chat‚Äù or whatever you want to call it where people can ask questions and engage during the Speaker Stage community call.

How much stETH in interest is the MOR team aiming to raise on this fair launch?


[2/25/2024 10:15 AM] cattaput123
think there is no aim, ppl can deposit or withdraw any amt,


[2/25/2024 10:15 AM] cattaput123
so no fixed amt, could be anything ig


[2/25/2024 10:16 AM] _0xbenjamin_
I know but is there a target or an already accumulated amount. I am wondering if it will be enough to sustain the development. Or is there other private sales ongoing?


[2/25/2024 10:19 AM] cattaput123
the info maybe is somewhere, maybe wait for the experts come online to tell you, im not so sure haha


[2/25/2024 10:23 AM] smartagents
There is no team. There is no company. So there is no one to set a target.


[2/25/2024 10:23 AM] smartagents
Anyone you see making a prediction is just expressing their personal opinion.


[2/25/2024 10:23 AM] smartagents

Sure, as promised)

**1 MOR will get a person who guess last three digits of the first deposit tx hash after 08:00pm UTC time on the 25th of Feb**

*Rules:*
- one person = one number 
- no spam
- only 3 digits numbers (100 .... 999)
- if the exact number is not guessed, the closest one wins
- numbers are counted from right to left

*Example:*
0xe96a915b1b5e95dd6ea73615d09fbe174ff2bc310c3dc7baa13684099b922f7f
The last three digits here are **722**

Happy guessing and let's the AI power be with you! 
:AI: :MOR: :Heart:

what is a smart agent?


[2/25/2024 6:43 PM] antonb
In short, it's your private AI that can interact with smart contracts on your behalf.
For example, you could ask him in voice to deposit 100 stETH to Morpheus smart contracts and withdraw when you reach a certain level of rewards. It will prepare everything for you and offer you to sign a tx.

[2/25/2024 8:31 PM] hardwood
By getting too smart


[2/25/2024 8:33 PM] antonb
Then you will need to implant an AI chip in your brain and take revenge.


[2/25/2024 8:34 PM] antonb
In reality, it's never sign tx but prepare everything for you making your web3 journey much easier

[2/25/2024 10:22 PM] antonb
Hi. Fair launch refers to the way Morpheus started on Feb 8th with equal opportunity for everyone. There were no premine, team tokens, private investors, token allocations, whitelists, etc. 

There are only two possible ways to obtain MOR:
- earn by contributing in one of four categories: capital (live), code (live), compute (~May) or community frontends (~July)
- buy on Uniswap Arbitrum starting from May 8th

Hey Trantor. I don't think any partnership is possible as Morpheus has no formal team, company and founder, but run by the community of open source contributors.

{Reactions}

[2/26/2024 1:58 PM] trantor
Sure. Well however it is done, I'd like to explore liquidity with us on Ramses on Arbitrum


[2/26/2024 1:59 PM] trantor
How best to propose something like that


[2/26/2024 2:00 PM] antonb
It will not done. That's set in Morpheus philosophy and value. If you wan't to list MOR when it's live - please do, you don't need any permission.


[2/26/2024 2:01 PM] trantor
Very cool


[2/26/2024 2:01 PM] trantor
And the staked ETH pools?


[2/26/2024 2:03 PM] antonb
What do you exactly mean?


[2/26/2024 2:11 PM] trantor
Well, we'd love to have some great MOR pools. And I am wondering if you plan to have stETH liquidity with WETH on arbitrum too.


[2/26/2024 2:12 PM] antonb
Yes, there will be MOR/wETH pool on Uniswap Arbitrum


[2/26/2024 2:12 PM] trantor
If you plan to give out MOR tokens, where does the liquidity come from if there is no team and no POL?


[2/26/2024 2:12 PM] trantor
Oh right


[2/26/2024 2:12 PM] trantor
Well we'd love to host that too


[2/26/2024 2:13 PM] trantor
Partnership simply means supporting that and ensuring you have an option to vote rewards there


[2/26/2024 2:14 PM] antonb
I'd kindly ask you to have a look at #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs to understand liquidity creation process better.
Now we are in the bootstrapping period when the protocol accumulates yield generated by deposited stETH (104k+ at the moment) and MOR tokens from the Protection Fund emissions to set initial AMM liquidity.

The thing is there is no one to support you. Everyone has the same role - open source contributors and anyone can contribute in one of the possible ways Morpheus provides. Think of Morpheus as Bitcoin. Can you conclude partnership with Bitcoin?


[2/26/2024 2:20 PM] trantor
Ok. Fair enough and very interesting. Your liquidity will be hosted on Uniswap. I'm suggesting it could be with us on Arbitrum and that you could vote rewards to the pool. I'm happy to leave that offer out there for the community

But if you ask about VCs, I believe they are among Capital Providers, as this is the only way for them to get MOR tokens now.

Usually all protocols have it
Sy if I m wrong

Thanks for the explanation. No referral codes for the deposits here as it opens a loophole for manipulations and against fair launch principles.

What exactly would one vote on?


[2/27/2024 9:45 AM] trantor
@shredder_gaming You vote emissions on to the pool. If the DAO chooses to hold the veNFT then they will be able to vote emissions directly onto the MOR LP and then capture trading fees. In other words, direct yield to the pool. Obviously the fees  captured can be used for whatever you want

Currently you can only participate with your stETH as Capital Provider and also, if you have technical skills, you could provide code to Morpheus GitHub repository.

Any wallet that supports EVM chains. You'll need both, ETH on mainnet and Arbitrum

hey @antonb | will not DM you ,
random question, I see a lot of code contributions in https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md. I was wondering if the emissions for those tokens have started already. Ie if someone has a contribution, how does it get determined how many tokens they get?


[2/28/2024 9:39 PM] crustyllama.
Or has it not been decided yet?


[2/28/2024 9:39 PM] crustyllama.
(Let me know if this better suited for tokenomics channel or somehwere else :))


[2/28/2024 9:43 PM] antonb
Thanks for your question.
Code contributor emissions have started along with others on Feb 8th and accrue on addresses you can see in the table. 
The reward approach is fully covered in the whitepaper, so brief answer is that the same as for capital providers, daily emissions distributed accordingly to share of each participant, additionally there is monthly snapshot that adds new eligible contributors.


[2/28/2024 9:44 PM] crustyllama.
@antonb | will not DM you thank you for your response. Would it be possible to walk through an example of this? For example how many hours a specific person put in, and how many MOR they received, and the calculations involved in reaching that number. I feel like this transparency would be greatly appreciated by the capital contributers.

I'm not the largest depositer, but still in the top 20 easily, and if I got some more details around this, I would be happy to add more capital to the pool. I'm sure others might be in simliar situation. Thank you üôÇ


[2/28/2024 9:47 PM] antonb
Agree, transparency is a key.
Here is an example from the wp:
> If there are 10 coders each having contributed 10% of the FTE time (denominated in weights) when the network launches, then each one gets 10% of the 3,456 MOR tokens each day = 345.6 MOR. This calculation is updated each month based on the cumulative FTE time (denominated in weights) contributions of the current mainnet version of the Morpheus software.

Currently it can be done manually by checking address from the contributors table directly in the contract, but in future there will be Code contributors portal with functionality you mentioned above.

@antonb | will not DM you . thank you so much for the thoughtful and detailed response. I think it has answered a lot of my questions except this, I have one last follow up question for a hypothetical scenario:
If there was a dev who spent infinite hours (impossible but lets pretend haha) on the first day of emissions, would those hours allow him to get a piece of every day's emission in perpetuity?


[2/28/2024 9:55 PM] crustyllama.
It is very rare to encounter a project with the vision and goals that Morpheus has. We capital contributers are lucky to be able to play a small part along its journey üôÇ

Another great point touched.

Here is another quote:
> The code base is ever evolving. Weights credited only last as long as the Code base / GitHub is utilizing the Code you provided. So as the Tech Stack changes the rewards can flow to those providing the current software being used.

Simply put, the code/documentation contributed will be reviewed periodically (maybe once in 6 or 12 months) and if it's outdated and has no use in Morpheus, it will be removed from contribution. This approach will keep contributors motivated to continually improve their code and keep new developers interested.

I fully share your thought. I can say that every contributor clearly understands the value of such things as decentralization, fairness, community, communication and security which is really rare to see in the current market, especially in the project that has no team, founders, company and investors.
Appreciate your support and feedback.

Hi Hammad. What type of proposal do you have?


[2/29/2024 4:22 AM] hammad.btc
we have investors/VCs


[2/29/2024 4:25 AM] antonb
Okay. In this case you can deposit to Morpheus contract and get MOR rewards like everyone else. 
Morpheus has no formal team, company or founders and develop by community of open source contributors. It also launched in fair way, without investments, allocations, team tokens, premine, etc, so everyone has the same opportunity and conditions.

I appreciate your interest to Morpheus, but the only way to obtain MOR tokens, if this is your intention, is to earn them, which is quite beneficial, as VCs maintain principle and contribute only stETH yield.

hi guys! how does one earn yield from staking eth on lido? is your stEth balance increasing in your wallet?


[2/29/2024 5:11 PM] antonb
That's correct, when stake on Lido you get rewards in stETH.


[2/29/2024 5:13 PM] antonb
But if you are going to deposit stETH into Morpheus contract you won't get yield as it goes to create protocol owned liquidity.


[2/29/2024 5:14 PM] cye_bigdaddy
so if i deposit 10 eth i get 10 stETH and after 1 year i will face around 10,3 stETH in the wallet? on LIDO


[2/29/2024 5:15 PM] antonb
Looks like that, depending on the average APR, but I think that the question would be better explained in Lido discord group.


[2/29/2024 5:17 PM] cye_bigdaddy
i never thoght about it until i deposited my stETH with youü§£


[2/29/2024 5:18 PM] cye_bigdaddy
so basically you are getting the extra rewards from stETH during the time i have my stEth with you

One more question, if you don't mind. Can your software deal with discord Captcha bot verification or maybe you'd recommend another verification method for Morpheus?


[2/29/2024 10:29 PM] 1272
they're likely bots purchased by a human, chrome extensions can automate switching of accounts.

in terms of verification, theres a flag to require phone number verification. 
its not perfect, but good numbers cost the same as 100 discord accounts.

Hey guys, I just started researching your project and find it very interesting and ambitious. At the same time I'm also looking a lot into Arweave and it's new AO project. I wonder if you have looked into AO yet? It seems to be a great platform for running AI agents. Are you considering using it, or would it slow down the development too much to change the infrastructure? I wonder if there are some great synergies between Mor and Arweave AO.

Are code providers currently paid with the assumption that MOR value is equal to (circ supply of MOR / current stETH yield)? Or will they be retroactively paid with market price post launch?

Current 0.0.5 release is a local LLM, while 0.0.6. will have web3 wallet connection and 0.0.7 will be able to do some magic with smart contracts. Eventually it will evolve to the node you can use as your local Smart Agent or Provide Compute/Connect your apps with Morpheus.

When Chrome tried to connect to morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. This may happen when an attacker is trying to pretend to be morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection.

[3/3/2024 2:44 AM] aldezo
anyone here familiar with OLAS? Can someone explain to me the difference to morpheus?


[3/3/2024 2:44 AM] aldezo
Seems to me like both provide autonomous services / agents to operate on smartcontracts


[3/3/2024 2:49 AM] antonb
From WPs:

**Morpheus**
Morpheus is designed to incentivize the first peer-to-peer network of personal general purpose AIs that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user, known as Smart Agents. 

**OLAS**
One single network for all the stuff that makes crypto work. Coordinated by the OLAS token and built on cutting edge, autonomous agent technology.

I need to dig deeper to provide you with answer, but maybe someone here is more familiar with OLAS than me


[3/3/2024 2:58 AM] aldezo
Autonolas‚Äô mission is to provide a foundation on which new types of autonomous
applications can be built, and which applications can do the following:
‚óè Run continuously.
‚óè Take action on their own.
‚óè Interact with the world outside of blockchains.
‚óè Run complex logic.
‚óè Be composed of self-contained application modules.
‚óè Be crypto-native: decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust.
In the context of blockchain, we call these applications off-chain services, as they run
primarily off-chain but are secured on-chain.
Autonolas provides the following:
‚óè The open-source software stack to realize these services.
‚óè An on-chain protocol, eventually deployed on all major smart-contract
blockchains, that secures these services and incentivizes their creation.
‚óè Tokenomics designed to attract more and more capital and developers into a
virtuous flywheel, in turn increasing the number of autonomous applications.
The Autonolas stack enables building of services made up of multiple agents


[3/3/2024 2:59 AM] aldezo
so olas seems more like a platform to build ai apps / agents


[3/3/2024 3:03 AM] antonb
Yeah, more like they provide tools to agent devs, when Morpheus is like Agents store with focus on both, devs and wider range of web3 users with ready infrastructure to make it function.


[3/3/2024 3:06 AM] antonb
I don't think they are competitors as devs could use Olas toolkits to build products and connect them to Morpheus.


[3/3/2024 3:07 AM] aldezo
i also think there will be tons of synergy between competent ai projects, just sometimes tought to grasp the specifics of each protocol

Hello Jesse. It's usually a good sign to do at least surface research of the project you want to connect with.

If look into #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs you'd know there is no formal team and founders and Morpheus is led by community of open source contributors.

[3/4/2024 9:51 PM] prophetpacks
awesome thank you for thr response. Anoter question. i kn ow this is a fair launch and no pre mined tokens, witht he 90 day lock up, is it correct that we start earning MOR tokens on may 8th, then 90 days later we can actually use/trade these tokens? And so 90 days after may 8th will be the first time anyone can actually trade the token? Or will there be tokens to trade starting May 8th?


[3/4/2024 9:55 PM] antonb
Actually there are not lockups except first 7 days after deposit. You started earn MOR tokens from the moment you deposited stETH and will be able to claim/trade your MOR rewards on May 8th.


[3/4/2024 9:55 PM] prophetpacks
Ahhh ok, so what is the 90 day period for?


[3/4/2024 9:56 PM] antonb
It called bootstrapping period when the protocol accumulates liquidity for initial AMM launch.

@antonb | will not DM you Hey buddy for the claim on May 8 do we claim with same ETH wallet or with an ARB wallet


[3/5/2024 12:43 PM] antonb
Hello! To my mind, "deposited" or "staked" suits better here as you always maintain your principal.


[3/5/2024 12:43 PM] antonb
Usually they are the same, you'll just need to switch chains

Nice. The button is greyed out, but might just be because I don't have stETH in my wallet?

is it better to start via stETH staking now or wait until the TGE in May? I guess there could be significatnt price appreciation between now and then? My biggest issue is the huge gas fees on EVM going from moving ETH to stETH on Lido staking and then to Morpheus. Thanks (and I guess this is just an issue all protocols currently face in EVM)

You can deposit stETH and get MOR rewards any time during 16 years of the first epoch. üôÇ

Good morning. Two questions, when MOR launches what is the actual date.? And when I buy it on MetaMask, do I only need to hold Ethereum in the wallet to make the swap? If no, can you please clarify the the process?. Thank you.


[3/6/2024 4:04 PM] antonb
GM friend! 
The MOR token is going live on decentralized exchange Uniswap on Arbitrum mainnet network on May 8th. You'll need to connect your wallet to Uniswap and if your intention is to buy MOR, you'll need to make a swap. For this you can use either ETH (on Arbitrum) or any other token supported by Uniswap.

so if it's not released , and if it's meant to become reference it would be nice to clarify that part or better : at least open for issues and PRs... but if it's in the node now, so let's work there sure... maybe i understood it wrong but reference is morpheusais term actually


[3/6/2024 5:51 PM] antonb

As it's DEX listing, in fact you can use any token supported by uniswap as it will be exchanged for wETH (Arbitrum ETH) and then swapped to MOR.

@antonb | will not DM you Mate is there any way i can move my ST ETH to a hard wallet without unstaking and restaking?


[3/7/2024 9:34 AM] jabo38.
You can use a hardware wallet with MetaMask. Just click "add hardware wallet"


[3/7/2024 9:34 AM] jabo38.
From that point on you put coins in your address associated with the hardware wallet and follow all the normal steps


[3/7/2024 9:35 AM] jabo38.
If you have already staked without hardware, you have to unstake then go through the process via your hardware wallet after its funded.


[3/7/2024 10:00 AM] hexmaster
You can send your stETH between addresses too. For example you can send your stETH to another ETH account (protected by your hardware wallet). It would just be sending an ERC20 token to another wallet, no different than sending SHIB or LINK around for example.


[3/7/2024 10:11 AM] surjir__

[3/7/2024 10:14 AM] confusedcoder
Is there any point in locking up ETH at this point for MOR tokens if it's under like 50ETH?


[3/7/2024 10:30 AM] jabo38.
Luckily this is a fair launch.  Meaning the that the biggest whales and biggest funds get the exact same rate as somebody who puts in sub 1 ETH.  So 0.5,  50, or 5000 ETH or not, the amount doesn't matter so much. 

The difference is the sub 1 ETH person has a much higher hit in their portfolio from the transaction fees to get the stETH and then deposit. 

But basically, if you have enough to make up your tx fee, then it is just as good for you as anybody else. 

There are also questions everybody has to ask themself and answer for themself. 

These are the following:  

Do I think the Morpheus token will appreciate more than what I would get from the yield of stETH? (after that overhead of the tx fee I mentioned)

And, while I have MOR tokens, would it be useful for me to have access to free AI compute? 

Every investor will have to find out if the risk/reward profile is a good fit for their portfolio.

One of the great things I love about the Morpheus TCM model is you get your stETH back anytime after 7 days. And then on top of that you have MOR tokens you can use to either use in defi, use to get free AI, or trade later for a possible profit (or loss).

Change it on the lido website

swap for it using ETH - you can use Curve for instance. Great DEX for swapping ETH/stETH. You can find it on Uniswap, 1inch, Paraswap, etc.

You can become Capital Providers and deposit them to Morpheus contract or keep with you, bridge to Arbitrum and buy MOR when it's live on May 8th.
Before making a decision, give a read to this great sum up by @jabo38.

Hey team, just a question referring to the quote above the 'Claim MOR', where it says: 

"Upon withdrawal, your deposit will be sent to your address. In case of claim, tokens will be minted in the Arbitrum One network. This may take some time."

I've made an OTC deal with a few of my MOR that falls through if I don't send them within 24hrs of launch (I lose my collatoral). I'm mainly referring to the last sentance where it says, 'this may take some time'. Do you believe there will be a delay in some users claiming tokens that could go beyond 24hrs from May 8th launch? 

Thanks!

You can't buy now. MOR token is going live on Uniswap Arbitrum on May 8th.

In arbitrum network?

There are two ways to get MOR:
- buy on Uniswap Arbitrum on May 8th
- earn by contributing to Morpheus as capital provider (stETH on Ethereum mainnet) or code provider

[3/8/2024 6:55 AM] shredder_gaming
I already have Metamask and on the Arbitrum network i have the MOR token (zero tokens atm obviously), I have connected to Uniswap via Metamask/Arbitrum. For now no MOR token is available for purchase. I presume somone will list it on the 8th of May and then you can buy it from there. So having some USDT or Eth or something in the Arbitrum wallet to get ready for the purchase is probably a good idea.

You got the idea right.
There will be a wETH/MOR liquidity pool set right before MOR becomes claimable, you'll need to connect your wallet and perform swap from one of the tokens you have to MOR.

Maybe I need to repeat that. Morpheus has no team or founders, but community of open source contributors. It's been launched in fair way, without premine, team tokens, VCs allocations, etc, which means there are no BD, PR or marketing budgets. No one is going to pay you.
Think of Morpheus as Bitcoin for AI. Would you approach Bitcoin and propose your promotion for 40$?

Hey all, A group I'm with is starting an AI accelerator that I think some folks from here might be interested in.  Where is the best place to post about this? Here?


[3/10/2024 12:31 AM] antonb
Hi. If someone is interested, they will reach you.


[3/10/2024 12:38 AM] antonb
You don't need to post a wall of text here. Your message above is enough to announce your proposal.

Hi, I‚Äôm very interested by the project but kinda new to crypto. How does it works ? Should I stake eth and then I‚Äôll get the equivalent in a few days on the Morpheus token ?


[3/10/2024 1:37 AM] antonb
Hi and welcome, in your case, the best point to start is #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

Thanks


[3/10/2024 1:39 AM] camnoippo_36653
So if I don‚Äôt stake, the Morpheus token should I theory be available on may the 9


[3/10/2024 1:39 AM] camnoippo_36653
And would be dependent on the staking of the zeth


[3/10/2024 1:40 AM] antonb
You can deposit stETH and get a piece of daily MOR emissions according to your share in the total pool (~110k stETH). The token will be claimable on May 8th.

Check DM, let's discuss details.


[3/10/2024 9:35 PM] antonb
I prefer to discuss publicly as there is nothing to hide.

The thing is that Morpheus is a solely open source project that  develops by community of open source contributors. There is no formal team or founders.


[3/10/2024 9:38 PM] antonb
If you want to invite someone to have an AMA, I think it's doable, but if your interest is in selling your services, there is no one who would pay for it.


[3/10/2024 10:18 PM] j0hnandrew
I have a huge community. If you want to do AMA for your project, you can do it for a small fee.

Yeah. Its helpful to understand that the Morpheus project has no Treasury. 
Coders, Capital, Compute, and Frontend Builders are all rewarded directly by the Protocol.
So its permissionless, anyone in the community can build or say what they want. 
If someone wants to list MOR or build something on the open source there is no one to ask permission from.

[3/11/2024 7:45 AM] dayofshah
is there a recommended amount of stETH to stake? or an optimal amount to benefit from the reward


[3/11/2024 9:03 AM] salwilliam
MOR emissions are proportionate to the amount of stETH staked. Whether you‚Äôre a small fish or a whale makes no difference. But I guess the eth gas fee will disproportionately disadvantage smaller capital contributors.

[3/11/2024 9:05 AM] salwilliam
Glad MOR will come into the world on Arbitrum so the community can avoid those brutal eth gas fees

makes perfect sense! so there


[3/11/2024 9:47 AM] dayofshah
so there are 2 fees to participate rn. converting ETH to stETH and then staking stETH w mopheus?


[3/11/2024 11:17 AM] antonb
There are three, as you need to approve stETH before depositing. 
I'd suggest using this tool to estimate your potential rewards

I did, that is where I got the numbers. That seems like a huge investiment for less than 2 MOR a month. That is why I feel like I am not doing it right, which in my case is very possible...

The rewards you got reflect your share in the total pool. At the moment, more than 110k stETH deposited, that means your share is extremely low.

Thanks, but how do I get the file to download?  Im not very familiar with GitHub.

There is no install file for 0.0.6 yet


[3/12/2024 3:38 AM] roccobarocco73
and 0.0.5 still doesn't work?

What the problem did you face with while installing 0.0.5?

It usually happens due to bandwidth issue. Takes a few minutes for your PC to download the model. Don't close the application while loading.

You need to draw your attention to links in the document as folder structure has been optimized, compute rewards and verification section as original one was replaced by the Yellowstone model and replace "hours" in Code rewards to weights.

quite how Cardano remains in the top 10  after all these years is truly baffling. And on a related point, ADA, out of all tokens, is the one that has the highest holding period on Coinbase. So the Cardano community are the most loyal holders out there! But why? What am I missing? Please somebody enlighten me!

Morpheus ought to be chain agnostic as described in the white paper. 
Let every Layer 1  and Layer 2 community add their value and use Smart Agents across chains.
That way every individual in the free market will decide. The size and interest of each tribe will be reflected in the usage of Morpheus : )

Use OTC services on your own risk. MOR token is going to be live on May 8th, but date can be moved in case of unforeseen circumstances.

This is really great news because MOR being only on Ethereum for capital providers really priced out the little fish, unfortunately. I understand the necessity for it, but I'm sure the capital provision will go up in multiples if it's possible to provide on Arbitrum. I remember when some DeFi protocols first started switching to L2s too. I think GMX's success can be attributed to that, for example.

## New Dashboard Improvements & MOR.ETH ENS Connection In Testing

Two important improvements in testing right now.

1. The "Wallet Connect" option has been added to the Capital Contributor Dashboard. You can test it out at this link. Report any bugs on the  #üö®Ô∏±tech-support channel. 
https://morpheus-dev.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/#/mainnet/capital

2. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address for the Morpheus Dashboard is now live for testing MOR.ETH https://mor.eth/ which resolves to this IPFS link: ipfs://bafybeigseyyspeqqwn6jowefx23yvgrmndsftospsowajzfyowfl5hc76q/#/mainnet/capital Again please report any bugs to Report any bugs on the  #üö®Ô∏±tech-support  channel.

The capital flows into the Morpheus Smart Contract continue to grow now over 115,000 + stETH worth over $400 Million USD. These upgrades should continue to increase the ease of how Capital Providers join the Morpheus community. Thanks to the Smart Contract devs for their work on these improvements.

Hello everyone, when will the token launch be and what can I do to participate in the pre-sale? Will there be a pre-sale or airdrop? Is there a task I can do right now for the project?


[3/16/2024 12:47 AM] antonb
Hi and welcome! The token is going to be live on May 8th and there is no presale or airdrop, but you can earn it by providing capital in form of stETH or code to the Morpheus repository.
All the details are in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

We don't get any ETH rewards from our stETH when we have it staked with MOR do we?


[3/16/2024 12:32 PM] seahusky22
Is the morpheus protocol at least getting them?


[3/16/2024 3:27 PM] antonb
That's correct, you provide generated by your stETH yield to Morpheus and getting rewarded in MOR tokens for that. The principal stays yours and carries no impermanent loss risks.

If 7 days have passed from your deposit, you can withdraw while gas is relatively cheap and move on with stETH rewards.

Morpheus has no team or founders, it's owned by community of opensource contributors.

Anyone can build on Morpheus. @Ex 
Depends on what they are doing, to understand what that means.
Smart Agents, Compute, Capital, Code or Frontends. Lots of ways they can build on Morpheus.
I see it as positive that people are listing Morpheus as something they are or want to build on. The more the merrier. Lot of people were building on Ethereum or planning to even before it launched. Keep growing the community. Morpheus is permissionless.

Hello, I want to invest in Morpheus, but I am looking for a source I can trust. Has any company invested in Morpheus?


[3/18/2024 4:11 AM] antonb
Nice question. Morpheus is different from 99% of projects you know as it's fully open source, community led and launched in the fair way. There is no company, team or founders, no allocations, no investments and team tokens.
Presently, you can obtain MOR by contributing either Capital in form of stETH or Code to the Morpheus GitHub. On more option is to buy MOR when it's live on Uniswap Arbitrum on May 8th.


[3/18/2024 4:30 AM] ex00x
Will the trading pair be stEth/Mor only?


[3/18/2024 4:34 AM] antonb
It's wETH/MOR on Uniswap Arbitrum.


[3/18/2024 4:39 AM] ex00x
I haven‚Äòt used Arb or wETH before. How would I obtain wETH on Arbitrum to swap for MOR?


[3/18/2024 4:43 AM] antonb
In fact, you can use any token on Arbitrum (+fees in ETH) that is supported by Uniswap to swap to MOR, so possible solution can be to bridge ETH from another chain.

It's called open source project owned by community. No company, no team, no founders, no investments or other hidden allocations. People contribute and the protocol awards them with tokens. It will make everything clearer if you think about Morpheus as Bitcoin in terms structure.

Hello and welcome. Could you elaborate a little more about partnership?


[3/18/2024 11:09 PM] smartagents
The Morpheus community should develop a "guide" at some point, that points people toward how to use the Morpheus Compute, or use Smart Agents or deploy their Smart Agents on Morpheus, or connect their Dapp / Smart Contract to Morpheus. Given the different types of value people can contribute to Morpheus and Morpheus can provide to them.

The existing Contributor guides are great, however they only focus on what people can add to Morpheus (Capital, Code, Compute, Frontends), they don't connect the dots for what Morpheus can provide other projects. So external folks can see how to connect Morpheus into their existing project.

Obviously "partnership" is a bit funny of a word. How would you partner with Bitcoin or Ethereum? But maybe some similar word that fits the permissionless nature of Morpheus. "Builders Guide" or something similar. Makes more sense to say a project is: "Building on Morpheus" than "partnering" with a company or foundation that doesn't exist.

[3/19/2024 12:41 AM] hexmaster
oh yes, always looking and checking. 

was just reading the conversations about partnerships and whatnot above from yesterday until now. pretty interesting. I love the approach of "think of morpheus as bitcoin" - but it is also a bit perplexing in the space of crypto/web3 where people want to have partnerships, but not so much "partnerships" as there are no partners, but - hmmmmm - perhaps collaborative efforts with some way of knowing it's cleanly handled by separate entities. I suppose that is the cognitive dissonance though. Morpheus being open-source with no team absolves it of being an "entity" - but it still serves a purpose as a platform (and is a bit like an entity, the way Bitcoin is an entity, albeit a decentralized, trustless, global entity).


[3/19/2024 12:42 AM] hexmaster
In all honesty however I'm more for the idea of "let the community built it up and create it" versus having literal collaborations or partnerships where 2 names are coming together etc. the ethos of Morpheus should sort of be "we can't have partnerships because everyone who participates is by default a partner, therefore nobody is a partner if you're not wanting to contribute and become a part of it yourself".


[3/19/2024 1:12 AM] antonb
That's deep, man.
I'd also add that majority of so called partnerships in crypto are about marketing, so when someone approaches and start talking about partnership first, he is saying "let's make some hype for both communities", because in order to use this or that tech you don‚Äôt need partnerships, you just take it and use it.

precisely. the ecosystem will speak for itself (the same way bitcoin has over the past decade). I think the idea of "there is no founding anything" is preferable and in the situation you're trading off that power for "partnerships" or "hype" - the ethos of crypto as a trustless platform for global settlement (or activity) is a bit lost. 

ultimately this is what allured me toward morpheus and what got me depositing the second day stETH deposits were opened. very very bullish on Morpheus and what it's going to bring to web3. üôÇ

[3/19/2024 5:07 PM] marsvikings
but across all deposits even the old ones...that should be made clear or communicated clearer...

Is it going to be only arb?


[3/19/2024 8:09 PM] antonb
Surely not, Arbitrum is the first chain, the ultimate goal is to be multichain by integration more yield generating assets and chains.


[3/19/2024 8:15 PM] birbs69
Why not go Eth first then other chains in the future


[3/19/2024 8:20 PM] antonb
Ethereum is obviously a good choice capital availability wise, but low fees are a must when we talk about token utility.

Hi. If your question is about timelines, you are not late, as emissions are not going to stop, they are the function of the protocol.
I'd ask you to dive into #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs for more information and use this tool to estimate your rewards https://morstats.info/staked_eth/

New Dashboard being rolled out that has Wallet Connect built in.

**The points about Morpheus everyone should be aware of:**

There are
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO token allocations
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 8th that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR  pro-rata proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

I have a question regarding MRC 20 approach: other projects kann use the mor smart contracts. So what value does that bring to Morpheus? Do projects have to pay fees?


[3/21/2024 10:50 PM] smartagents
Great question. As a default in the code the Morpheus platform charges 0.35% of the yield (out of the 3.5% yield generated). This yield from the third party project goes into the Morpheus Protocol Owned Liquidity. This is similar to the model Uniswap or Lido uses.

Thus every project that uses the MOR20 Smart Contracts is helping provide more resources to fund additional Smart Contract work, Dashboard improvements, and audits of the MOR20 code.

Anyone could alter the code to remove this cost, but then the Morpheus community is unlikely to feature that project in its Dashboards or want to support it with yield from stETH or MOR.

You might to use this website to estimate potential returns from the deposited stETH.
https://morstats.info/staked_eth/


[3/22/2024 12:59 PM] antonb
Staked stETH for earning MOR token is only one part of the story.
Morpheus has been launched fairly, meaning equal opportunities for everyone without any pre-allocations or team tokens. Users can only earn tokens or buy them (after May 8th).
Besides Capital providers, there are also code and compute providers as well as community frontend builders who can also be rewarded with daily MOR emissions.

can someone clarify how MOR market will be launched?


[3/22/2024 1:56 PM] chichi33
"The Capital Provider Smart Contract will provide 50% of the stETH yield produced to the Morpheus swap function. The swap buys the MOR tokens from an Automated Market Maker (AMM) then pairs them with the rest 50% of the stETH yield and lock into the AMM Liquidity Pool as PoL."


[3/22/2024 1:57 PM] chichi33
I was under the impression that on May 8th the team was going to take 50% of the stETH yield generated abd pair it with MOR.

Is the team the one that will launch the market? At what mcap the pool will be launched?

You can't provide Compute until compute contract and router are up and running. This is planeed for May/June, please follow the announcements.

# Morpheus 0.0.6 Version Release Notes: Mac + Linux + Windows Installs
This is the first version of Morpheus that brings together an open source LLM (defaults to Llama2) + connecting a user's Meta Mask wallet + executing on chain transactions via a ETH focused Smart Agent. Big thanks to @Maxwell_Smart_Agent @domsteil @lachsbagel @Ishshogun @jabo38. @TigerBuidl @antonb | will not DM you @Christopher  (Morpheus) and the many other coders and testers who contributed to this release.

## After connecting Morpheus to your Meta Mask, you can test it by taking basic actions such as:
"What is my balance?"
"What is my address?"
"Send ETH to Ethereum Address"

Morpheus doesn't have a connection to a block explorer or price oracles yet, so it can't answer general transactions questions. It just answers the above examples based on info from the Meta Mask wallet you connect.

## Warnings:
- Review all transactions before approving them. The LLM makes mistakes, you have human wisdom.
- Seriously, double check all actions in the Meta Mask interface before sending money.
- This is an experimental release and the ETH Smart Agent may try and send your money into a black hole. 
- Gas costs are high on Ethereum. Consider testing out 0.0.6 using the Sepolia testnet or Arbitrum.

The purpose of Morpheus is stated in the very beginning of the white paper as the p2p network for powering Smart Agents, though it's not limited only with this use case.

I love analogy @SmartAgents use, that Morpheus is the platform for decentralized AI solutions like Ethereum is the platform for smart contracts.

I hope this addresses your confusion. üôÇ

looking at that its similar.
mostly interested in getting a 7day ROC for the staking wallet, and extrapolating it. Then using the lido API to model liquidity predictions.

In web3, when you say the word "team" it means a group of people working within one entity under contracts conditions, with specific positions and responsibilities which is not the case with Morpheus as it's open source project. 
In this regard Morpheus contributors prefer not to use this word.

At its heart everything contributors are adding to the Morpheus platform from Code to Capital to Compute is designed to empower builders to create and deploy Smart Agents to users. Smart Agents that are directed by individuals, permissionless, open source, and provide unrestricted intelligence to the world.

What Ethereum is to Smart Contracts, Morpheus is to Smart Agents. A neutral platform for all to leverage. A protocol not owned or controlled by any company or central party. Fair launched and built in public from day one.

Hello, my name is Dasha, and I am the owner of a popular TikTok account with 6 million subscribers. You can find me at @Dasha Chepizhko on TikTok.

Welcome! ü§ó
There is no person you can talk to  about a marketing proposal if it's about "pay me for promo" as Morpheus has no formal team, company and marketing budget.
But if you find Morpheus interesting for your subscribers, and you're gonna craft  some content for them, there are users who can help you with needed information.

Choose a wallet address for claim MOR on Arbitrum is certainly the feature that is going to be added at launch, but it has not properly tested yet, so there is a tiny chance that it will be added after May 8th.

And with a unlock date much later than the first MOR coming into circulation may 8


[3/26/2024 10:31 PM] tigerbuidl.
It isn't locked for 90 days but 7 as you can withdraw your stETH after 7 days


[3/26/2024 10:32 PM] gitbre
How much would 1 stETH have earned me in MOR tokens? If I withdraw the 1 stETH after 7 days?


[3/26/2024 10:33 PM] antonb
You are not locking funds for 90 days, it's just 7 day initial lockup.
Also fair launch is not limited with 90 days period, emissions won't stop after this.
I'd kindly ask you to take a look at #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs which briefly explains all major points about Morpheus.

No one is "running **Compute** nodes for **MOR rewards**" on Morpheus yet. Perhaps they "intend" to in the future. Compute rewards are in phase two of Morpheus. Depends on when the Decentralized Router is pushing into production. Current guess is May / June.

For Compute https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus-Lumerin-Node Note that this is not live until Phase 2
For Capital https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital


[3/28/2024 7:14 AM] kimjongbro
for the compute, is it basically that I run a node?


[3/28/2024 8:15 AM] jabo38.
There aren‚Äôt exactly full nodes on Morpheus like in Bitcoin and Ethereum because it‚Äôs not a blockchain but a series of contracts. The compute providers then offer the AI and smart agent models.


[3/28/2024 8:29 AM] kimjongbro
so providing compute is like hosting the model itself for others to interact with?


[3/28/2024 8:43 AM] smartagents
Correct. This is referred to as "Inference". And while yes Inference can be used to train models, its more often people just want to send a prompt to an existing model and get a reply.

Hi. Morpheus node is not the type of node that run blockchain and process transactions and running node itself won't provide you with rewards.

# New Morpheus Dashboard URL For Web2 Style Browsers: Dashboard.Mor.org

Mor.org one of the most popular community websites for Morpheus has created a new link to the Morpheus Dashboard.
https://dashboard.mor.org/#/mainnet/capital

This will make it easy for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and other Web2 style browser users to access the Dashboard.

The MOR.ETH ENS address will continue to also host the Morpheus Dashboard, however given its ENS / Web3 / IPFS usage it only resolves for users of the Brave Browser.

[4/1/2024 10:29 AM] smartagents
May 8th MOR becomes claimable / sendable on Arbitrum.
Not so much an airdrop, as the tokens currently exist, they are just claimable at the end of the 90 bootstrapping period.
Note anyone can continue providing stETH yield to Morpheus after May 8th, that just when the tokens / AMM go live.

[4/1/2024 2:57 PM] antonb
Hi. Morpheus is launching is phases and MOR utility will reveal with each new milestone.
Now we are at the Phase 1. Capital and Code providers, next is Compute, which is Phase 2 (~May/June) and finally Phase 3. Frontend builders is likely to be live in July/August.
There will not be staking for network security as Morpheus is not a blockchain, but more like chain agnostic set of the smart contracts.


[4/1/2024 2:58 PM] antonb
What do you mean exactly under "community allocation"?


[4/1/2024 2:59 PM] _0xbenjamin_

No governance planned, frontend emissions structure are under discussion in the corresponding MRC threads you are welcome to join:

In short, Compute emissions will be distributed based on the compute actually provided through a competitive bid process.

Does Morpheus do anything at the moment? What will the use case be for my 3 tokens? Seems like very little token for such a large amount of ETH in my eyes. How will the price be set? Kind of sad if the token is say 0.00000001 cents. But if it is say $100 per token on launch then how can this be useful or who would buy it. If the token is used by AI then surely the lower value the better?


[4/2/2024 6:08 PM] antonb
Hi there. That's relevant question! 
Here is the brief update:

1) Morpheus is growing in number of contributors in each category.
There are 5000+ capital contributors and according to my estimates, around 200 developers who provide code. 

2) The next launch phase (after May 8th) is Compute, where MOR holders will start getting their daily compute quota (which is essential utility) and compute providers be rewarded accordingly to work done.

3) Compute Router and Contract are in active development by @Ryan Condron. You can learn about underlying concept from this [doc](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Morpheus%20Node%20Core%20Architecture%20and%20Design%20Principles.md).  

4) Quite a lot of incredible and thoughtful discussions happen recently in #mrc-forum. I'd recommend you to check, especially if you are seeking to be contributor.

5) The AMM deployment plan has been crafted to eliminate possible risks and ensure smooth launch. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/The%20Morpheus%20Asset%20Integration%20Framework.md)

6) MOR price will be determined by market powers, but here is the model you can use to estimate probable listing price.

Just to make it clear: anyone can use Morpheus as "technology", so they can say: "we will utilize Morpheus compute" or "We are going to launch Smart Agent for Morpheus" which is totally fine.
But if someone claims about "partnership" or "collaboration with Morpheus team" these are false statements.

@antonb | will not DM you not sure who best to ask but I was thinking Morpheus could benefit from community growth ventures. Kinda like a mini marketing agency that works for Morpheus, is there a way to propose this?


[4/3/2024 2:35 AM] antonb
Yes, you can propose and welcome to do that. How do you feel about the idea to collect some feedback first? I'm particularly curious of the budgeting model you see fit for this venture.


[4/3/2024 2:36 AM] abandm_mike
yea well thats what I was hoping to do


[4/3/2024 2:38 AM] abandm_mike
obviously it falls outside of the 4 funding areas, so I was looking for some guidance as to how something like this could be proposed


[4/3/2024 2:47 AM] antonb
You touched an interesting topic and I agree that funding falls outside of 4C's.
Possible sources of funding could be:
- grants from the community members
- community funding
- possible solutions based on community app builders part of emissions (For example. You can your mini marketing agency to help app/smart agent builders attract users and share part of the income)


[4/3/2024 2:49 AM] abandm_mike
yea I was think it could be a mini marketing agency agent and get emissions from the community funding potentially?


[4/3/2024 2:49 AM] abandm_mike
"grants from the community members
community funding" how would either of these potentially work?

The same as early Bitcoiners fund various community members initiatives.
Community funding works the same, but with contributions from many users.
I do believe that you will be able to find funding relatively easy if your agency can bring tangible value.


[4/3/2024 3:16 AM] abandm_mike
ok so, say I put together a proposal for a community growth team that has a bunch of growth initiatives. and put that in a doc, how can we take that to the community to get funding? is there a process or mechanism for that? any precedent?


[4/3/2024 3:57 AM] antonb
This could potentially lie under [MRC (Morpheus Request for Comments)](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC00.md) procedure, but the chances of it being accepted are negligible. Maybe the optimal move now would be to wait until more compute providers and app builders are coming with phase 2 and 3 launch and looking for collaboration with them.

@abandm_mike he is not wrong the chance of this being accepted is basically zero because the MRC process requires approval from unidentified individuals who hold the power ( who apparently are not part of a core team)

sorry if it came across the wrong way


[4/3/2024 3:59 PM] antonb
Perhaps I didn't understand you correctly.  
Let me clarify my position.  Those people who manage the repositories are some of the most devoted adopters of decentralization, who have been following this approach for more than 10 years and have made a huge contribution to the development of the entire crypto industry.  
Every feedback is taken as seriously as possible and with the greatest possible transparency.  

And when someone starts saying that Morpheus has a team, not community driven, that something is opaque and centralized, without giving arguments or offering anything in return, then this is a total devaluation of the efforts of contributors, disrespect for the community, toxic behavior and FUD.

As far as I know, there are no plans to have incentives for marketing initiatives. 
At the Phase 3 you could potentially build frontend that will route compute or capital providers to Morpheus and be rewarded with MOR emissions for that, but it's still in the discussion.

hey guy. Where will the token pre-sale take place?


[4/3/2024 10:09 PM] abandm_mike
So essentially there is no way, now or the future to allocate any funds to community growth type of activities?


[4/3/2024 10:30 PM] antonb
There is no presale.


[4/3/2024 10:34 PM] antonb
According to tokenomics, there are only four categories of contributors that can be awarded in MOR tokens:

- capital providers
- compute providers
- code providers
- community frontend builders

The type of community growth activity you describe, potentially can fall under community frontend builders, but it has nothing to do with the marketing agency.


[4/3/2024 10:36 PM] abandm_mike
yea that I understand, Is there anyway though the MRC mechanism or any other way to change this in the future if the community wanted it?

I don't think so, as these are fundamental protocol changes and each of the categories has its purpose and I can't see a scenario when something like BD or marketing can be integrated in the decentralized manner when there is no obvious need in it.

Don't get me wrong, nothing can stop you from submitting the MRC, but this would require a unique technical solution and review of the whole Morpheus tokenomics.

[4/3/2024 11:38 PM] salwilliam
I suppose tokens might naturally flow to BD or other non-technical work thru projects that already earn MOR. eg. a dev team has an app that works but recognizes it could be more successful (and earn more MOR) if they brought in something like a BD strategist

At Lighthouse, we use IPFS and Filecoin to securely store files permanently. Yes, I seen the Guide, and I also read the whitepaper, which stated that filecoin will be used to store the data of smart agents.


[4/5/2024 4:10 PM] antonb
To my mind, MRC is the best route for you, but before submission it's helpful to talk with a repo maintainer.
@SmartAgents could suggest the best person to connect with.

Hi, I have a question about the website links to the staking dashboard. In the verified links tab, it says this is the website:

Capital: Dashboard for Capital Contributors (https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/#/mainnet/capital)

But from the mor.org page for the fair launch details, it links to a different url:

https://dashboard.mor.org/#/mainnet/capital

Are both of these legitimate?

disclosure about myself: I wrote the juicebox protocol (https://docs.juicebox.money/dev) which is a language to express incentive design, and am now playing with revnets (https://revnet.eth.limo) which is an articulation of juicebox purpose built to power open source projects of builders, investors, and community of users around revenues.

the paper makes note of these forces that you're trying to balance:
- community of users
- builders contributing to the Morpheus software / agents
- investors funding development / ops
- providers suppling computation
correct?


[11/8/2023 1:30 AM] jango420
are there any bits of central operational overhead that need to be addressed and funded?


[11/8/2023 1:35 AM] jango420
the paper has no mention of revenue. how are you thinking about network revenue? do you think it's not needed?


[11/8/2023 1:41 AM] smartagents
Close. There are no investors, just liquidity providers, as capital providers will provide Staked ETH and only provide the ETH yielded and compete to get part of the MOR rewards.


[11/8/2023 1:42 AM] smartagents
Nothing centralized. There is no company. No foundation. No governance. On purpose.

[11/8/2023 1:43 AM] smartagents
The paper talks about MOR being burned as part of fees. I don't know if that would be considered "revenue" for the network but it makes the tokens more scarce.


[11/8/2023 1:43 AM] smartagents
The MOR tokens are also burned via the ETH to MOR swap from the funds provided by Capital providers.


[11/8/2023 1:50 AM] jango420
are these prices hardcoded? or set dynamically by each provider?

Set dynamically by each provider. Best to have a free market price emerge.


[11/8/2023 3:20 AM] smartagents
However in the early days I expect the cost of compute to be very low given the global nature of competition and the vaue the MOR rewardds offer compute providers


[11/8/2023 3:26 AM] jango420
can tokens other than MOR be used to fulfill these exchanges? best to have a free market decide which token is used here too?


[11/8/2023 4:04 AM] smartagents
Only MOR makes sense. There needs to be a balance of supply and demand. Of emmissions and burning.


[11/8/2023 4:04 AM] .axilo
Would kind of take away the idea of having a token in the first place


[11/8/2023 4:04 AM] smartagents
Swaps are so easy now anyone can swap tokens for something else if they care to build an interface that uses USDC for example but pays the required MOR in the backend.

Different open source developers from around the world have been coding the Morpheus node, the smart contracts and other people are building front end websites. www.Mor.org for example just launched.  There is https://www.morpheusai.org/ for developers. Some of them are known some are anon. I respect that. I care about code quality and that its all open source not identity.

do you think the morpheus product inherently depends on its tokenomics in order to be successful?


[11/8/2023 1:17 PM] smartagents
I think all crypto projects to be public goods and act as neutral platforms have to have tokens. The invention satoshi gave us was a way for software to pay for its own hardware.


[11/8/2023 9:56 PM] jango420
I agree. I'm just curious if you think the the system itself only works in the case of a token, or if the tokenized engine can effectively sit next to the main working product. I hear you, in the case of morpheus it all seems fairly embedded. it also sounds like the project is pretty set on how it wants to run. Are Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo around for us to ask them questions and help refine the system? You mentioned earlier "The challenges are in how to properly implement the proofs for each reward.", i agree and i think its worth talking about to see if we can improve the system!

@SmartAgents reposting here 


It‚Äôs an interesting concept but you are emitting and paying capital providers MOR in order to buy less MOR so the net result is more supply vs demand? 

Keen to hear the thought process behind it, is it as a way to try and draw in more people and make accumulating MOR easy and accessible vs having to provide compute and thus a way to grow the community?


[11/30/2023 2:10 AM] smartagents
Thanks.


[11/30/2023 2:10 AM] smartagents
Was just thinking through this the other day.


[11/30/2023 2:11 AM] smartagents
Thanks for the thoughts.

I think of the primary function it serves is to provide liquidity for any MOR sellers. So say someone earns MOR for providing compute and has to sell some to cover power / compute costs, they need a buyer. This TCM module gives a constant buyer to any seller. I think this is very important for the first few years of the network as liquidity is a key to success and demand will take a while to scale and fill this function.


[11/30/2023 2:19 AM] smartagents
I think proof of work and proof of Stake are both important.


[11/30/2023 2:19 AM] smartagents
You need incentives for Capital, Compute, Community and Code.


[11/30/2023 2:20 AM] smartagents
Just like the early days of Ethereum. It was developers who were rewarded for the code that were contributed before the Genesis block.


[11/30/2023 2:21 AM] smartagents
That put resources into the hands of people who wanted to build Smart Contracts / Dapps.


[11/30/2023 2:22 AM] smartagents
I think the key to the Morpheus community is rewarding folks who want to build Smart Agents, Models, and Compute for Decentralized AI.


[11/30/2023 2:25 AM] kblkusamakingdom
Yes this makes sense to me and allows me to understand the below sentence from the docs, so the theory is that contributors can convert their MOR into ETH easily and be paid for their work while the protocol matures 

'It's important that at the beginning liquid resources such as ETH are used to pay devs and for equipment'

One of my original thoughts was around this being done in a way to create POL instead

üëçüèº 

[11/30/2023 2:26 AM] kblkusamakingdom
I really like the way there are multiple routes to acquire MOR from contributing to the protocol vs just providing compute like many fair launches these days are done e.g. Bittesnor, Kapsa etc

[11/30/2023 3:46 AM] jonisjon
If the main impetus is to provide liquidity - perhaps it would be better to just LP that eth (maybe in a PoL way as mentioned) with MOR?


[11/30/2023 3:47 AM] jonisjon
In that case the AMM is always the buyer anyway when someone wants to sell


[11/30/2023 3:47 AM] jonisjon
I guess buying and burning MOR also does have a similar effect, in the end more eth ends up in the pool


[11/30/2023 3:51 AM] emersondickie

I don't see anything in the paper about incentives for the testnet.


[11/30/2023 3:57 AM] smartagents
I hear what you are saying. Though the burning seems cleaner to me. No treasury. No pool.


[11/30/2023 3:58 AM] jonisjon
Well no DAO treasury, but there will have to be a pool right?


[11/30/2023 3:58 AM] jonisjon
Pool here refers to an lp/AMM pool

[11/30/2023 11:26 AM] smartagents
I hear you. Though when I think at tokenomics systems I look for simplicity. I like the simplicity of the burn. The buy provides liquidity, the burn increases scarcity. As soon as there are pooled funds it tends to devolve to a long debate over how to spend them, add in a bunch of governance and politics and different incentives and things get complex fast.


[11/30/2023 11:42 AM] shiny_shiba_
I agree simplicity is good. I think if you simply lock the liquidity indefinitely, then it's the same thing as a burn except that its built in liquidity that allows anyone to trade in and out. Imo it accomplishes the same thing as burn but has benefit in liquidity. If it's locked / nobody can access it, then there's nothing to argue about


[11/30/2023 11:42 AM] shiny_shiba_
Governance can get messy so agree it's good to aviod and just have one mandate for that yield - indenfinitely locked liquidity for mor<>eth

Whats the difference in trading 1 TKN in a pool of 100 TKN .. vs .. 0.1 TKN in a pool of 10 TKN.. liquidity just means people willing the buy/sell. Not quantity of TKNs


[11/30/2023 12:32 PM] jonisjon
In theory if that is the goal, it could be that the eth is used to buy MOR, lp with it, and then burn the lp token

[11/30/2023 6:06 PM] kblkusamakingdom
Yeah great points. 

I kind of agree with @JonisJon point of the simplicity of the burn does make it easier vs creating POL, which yes can kick up revenue for a protocol but often protocols use that as a way to drive revenues when they lack a real utility/use case. This project does not suffer from that 

and your point 2) in a way the burn is already funding development as it is allowing the developers who are earning MOR from emissions to sell for the ETH yield. 

It is great to see innovative thinking either way and is something i am sure can be voted on and moulded as the protocol matures as we see the impacts/

[12/1/2023 4:36 AM] shiny_shiba_
A few names come to mind but let me confirm and get back to you in a bit


[12/1/2023 4:43 AM] shiny_shiba_
This first assumes that there is existing liquidity in the MOR<>ETH pool to start though. 

Liquidity doesn't mean people willing to buy / sell. Liquidity is how efficient someone can buy or sell - deeper liquidity = less price impact. There is a big difference in being only able to trade 1 TKN out of 100 or 0.1 TKN in 10. It's the sign of a healthier market to be able to sell more with lower slippage. 

Also, in theory yes, using 100% of yield to buy MOR will put more ETH into the LP. But again, that assumes the LP has sufficient liquidity in there. Healthy market through deep liquidity > buying 2x more MOR with ETH yield IMO.

(Btw I appreciate the conversation here and hope none of this comes off as combative, just want to add to the discussion)


[12/1/2023 4:44 AM] jonisjon
yes and the obvious downside vs depositing LP and burning the LP tokens is that whoever IS providing liqudiity to the pool could just take out the eth whenever


[12/1/2023 4:44 AM] jonisjon
if its PoL put in by the protocol it would never leave


[12/1/2023 4:45 AM] shiny_shiba_
Oh I agree that in this case the protocol should take the yield from ETH and buy half MOR and half as ETH then LP and burn the LP


[12/1/2023 4:45 AM] shiny_shiba_
I think that's amazing - you still burn MOR and liquidity is locked and market is more liquid


[12/1/2023 4:45 AM] jonisjon
im actually not sure which is better, ideally some of both would happen, but if for simplicity its only one I think there are positives and negatives to both approahces


[12/1/2023 4:46 AM] kblkusamakingdom
Burn the LP? Why would you burn liquidity positions


[12/1/2023 4:46 AM] shiny_shiba_
"and your point 2) in a way the burn is already funding development as it is allowing the developers who are earning MOR from emissions to sell for the ETH yield. " 
^ Not necessarily - again, this is under the assumption that sufficient liquidity exists. If nobody LP's then there's not liquidity to sell into.


[12/1/2023 4:46 AM] kblkusamakingdom
more specifcally burn ETH


[12/1/2023 4:46 AM] jonisjon
there will always be some liqudiity, even if its very small


[12/1/2023 4:47 AM] jonisjon
in this case I think it will rise pretty quickly


[12/1/2023 4:47 AM] shiny_shiba_
Two reasons:
1) Original proposal was that ETH yield would buy MOR and then burn that MOR. The value of that yield is effectively burned. Whether its ETH burnt or not, imo is negligible as the economic value at current time is being burnt
2) Community seems to want MOR being burnt (I like that too). If you LP MOR<>ETH then burn the LP token you effectively burn the MOR but the burnt LP token still serves a purpose in providing liquidity for the overall market


[12/1/2023 4:48 AM] jonisjon
well when you burn the LP token the MOR isn't really burned to be fair


[12/1/2023 4:49 AM] jonisjon
it can still be bought and re-enter supply via anyone paying for it, what you are burning is the right to withdraw liqudiity from the pool


[12/1/2023 4:49 AM] shiny_shiba_
Yes it can still be taken out if you wanted to swap ETH that's a fair detail


[12/1/2023 4:49 AM] shiny_shiba_
My thinking of burn in that case was that nobody "owns" it anymore but you're right you can swap eth into it


[12/1/2023 4:50 AM] jonisjon
I really do think ideally it would be both


[12/1/2023 4:50 AM] jonisjon
like for the first month or two, its all liqudiity added to the pool, then it changes to buy MOR and burn it

[12/1/2023 4:50 AM] kblkusamakingdom
Oh i think we are using the term burn differently. How are you burning tokens and still providing them as liquidity? In my definition of burn they go to the burn address and are no longer in circulation.


[12/1/2023 4:50 AM] jonisjon
you provide LP and burn the LP tokens (the reciept tokens that give you the right to withdraw from the pool)

[12/1/2023 4:50 AM] shiny_shiba_
There are a lot of otkens out there with really low liquidity so i do think there's a case to be made in at least bootstrapping the liquidity and potentially moving to burn later

Is MOR planning to incentivize people to LP eth<>MOR via MOR emissions? I suppose it can happen but people usually won't want to risk on impermanent loss unless there is sufficient yield from emissiosn to mitigate that risk


[12/1/2023 4:51 AM] shiny_shiba_
what Jonis said


[12/1/2023 4:51 AM] jonisjon
so the underlying ETH/MOR in this example is still buyable and doesn't leave supply, but there will always be some proportional amount of liquidity that is forever in the pool

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/1/2023 4:52 AM] shiny_shiba_
IMO 99% of users won't know how to manage univ3 range pools and most will probably lose to impermanent loss. And it may be hard for market makers to step in especially early days when ciruclating supply of MOR is very low b/c emissions haven't had a long time to go for

Protocol boostrapping liquidity imo is the best use of funds in the early days

[12/1/2023 4:57 AM] shiny_shiba_
I also think projects like Unibot did some clever things with building their own liquidity (Not saying add a tax on trades but just showing how protocols can bootstrap their own liquidity)

Again, separate this piece with the rest of the project


[12/1/2023 5:00 AM] shiny_shiba_
(TLDR on unibot before they changed it, 5% tax on any unibot trade and 20% of that 5% tax went to unibot liquidity pool - it's not exatcly the same as this MOR discussion but just another example of how protocols can bootstrap liquidity and that protocols want to bootstrap liquidity)


[12/1/2023 5:03 AM] shiny_shiba_
and yes i think something like this sounds good (i recognize it complicates things though) - detail is in the time frame but generally think bootstrap liquidity then can migrate over to just pure burning MOR 

Otherwise it just feels like the protocol doesn't really get the most benefit out of the staked ETH other than "pump my bags" but protocol is paying more MOR in emissions than it's buying with the yield so it just feels like an inefficient use of funds and is still net inflationary


[12/1/2023 5:04 AM] jonisjon
yea, agreed. If we could assume 100% of LPs would just sit passively forever, then buying + burning MOR would be superior IMO - however we can't and shouldn't assume that, and so some "critical mass" of LP first added by the protocol may be preferable before switching to just buying and burning MOR


[12/1/2023 5:06 AM] shiny_shiba_
I agree ü´°


[12/1/2023 7:11 AM] erikvoorhees
If you burn LP tokens, doesn't that mean the liquidity is stuck in that specific pool forever? What happens when the market moves to another pool? X-swap V2 or whatever


[12/1/2023 7:39 AM] shiny_shiba_
Hey Erik, that's a good detail, thx for pointing it out. Yes the liquidity is stuck in that specific pool forever. If the community wanted to make a new pool, they can do that but that burnt liquidity would not be able to be moved. However, with dex routers, that liquidity would still help fill order flow so it can still be useful. 

In the alternative situation (what's written on the website) where ETH yield buys MOR and then that MOR is burnt, that MOR is taken out of circulation via burn anyways and liquidity is never bolstered using ETH yield, so I still view this alternative proposal as a net value add even if the community wants a new pool in the future.

The liquidity could also be locked instead for x time duration and then decided to be burnt after, but this does add complexity and potential governance lag.


[12/1/2023 8:39 AM] erikvoorhees
good point


[12/1/2023 8:39 AM] erikvoorhees
I'm not sure where I stand on this question


[12/1/2023 8:42 AM] jonisjon
Yea having the optionality to move/do something with the liquidity later makes sense if there is a DAO/governance of some type - but my understanding is there is no such governance in the current model right?


[12/1/2023 8:53 AM] shiny_shiba_
Thx for engaging. I feel that the eth yield can be used more effectively than just buying MOR and burning it. ETH is a precious resource so want to see it be put to good use üôè 

When I first read that MOR will be emitted to eth providers, it reminded me of early defi summer single sided farms like Yam.finance for example. It may attract a lot of mercenary capital that will farm and dump. As an outsider reading the website, it made me a bit confused as to the MOR emission to ETH providers mechanism.

At least getting something out of the mercenary capital such as POL seems better than just buy and burn. Mercenaries may move onto the next farm with their eth but at least their eth yield will remain as liquidity for the community. (A counterpoint to my own argument though is that theoretically this provides liquidity for dumpers to dump on - but farmers are going to dump anyways regardless)


[12/1/2023 9:15 AM] shiny_shiba_
Hm i ran some numbers and I can see how this can be net deflationary vs net inflationary. My initial confusion came from an assumption that there would be more MOR emitted than the stETH couldbuy and burn per day making this net inflationary. 

**Example (attached a screenshot also):**
If MOR FDV is $30M and therea are 42M total tokens in supply, then price/MOR is $0.71 (30/42). Let's say it's the part of the curve where MOR is emitting 10K MOR / day with 24% to capital providers, so 2,400 MOR per day to capital providers. That's $1,714 USD worth of MOR (2400*0.71)

If there is also $30M of stETH yielding 4%, that's $1.2M of ETH yield per year or $3,288 per day which can buy 4,603 MOR per day at $0.71.

So in this specific example (the outcome changes with MOR FDV and amount of stETH + the staking rate) it's net deflationary of 2,203 MOR (4,603 minus 2,400).
=================================

I still do like POL better but I can see how this current proposal could end up being net deflationary - I made the assumption it wouldn't be but I can see how the math works out. I suppose you also get some Ethereum alignment and people will talk about it more. 

Thinking about it now though i wonder if there's an angle to be had that this ETH could also restake (like EigenLayer) to provide more utility but think that's getting out of scope / more complicated than needed. I just feel like there could be more the ETH can be doing to be productive / additive than sitting still and yielding to buy/burn.

What if it was rETH or divETH (when out) so less centralized *


[12/1/2023 12:11 PM] .rocky_c
This is very interesting! Suppose someone invests $100,000 in ETH. Their daily earnings would be calculated as follows: ($100,000 worth of ETH / $30 million total in stETH) * 4603, which approximately equals 15 MOR tokens per day. Therefore, with a $100,000 investment, one would earn 15 MOR daily. 

However, if you were to purchase MOR tokens directly with the same amount, you would own approximately 100 times more tokens. This makes the investment option less attractive, as buying MOR directly allows you to own significantly more tokens than you would by providing capital in the form of ETH. Thoughts?


[12/1/2023 12:17 PM] shiny_shiba_
thx üôè  it would be * 2400 in the above not *4603 (the x4603 is how muhc the yield buys and burns and 2400 is how much is distributed)

But yea generally earning from emissions will be slower than just out right purchasing it - but then you are taking price risk against ETH. It's not a guarantee that the token will outperform ETH. So yes, you can buy more MOR (assuming there is liquidity) than you would get from emissions, but then you take price risk vs. if you get MOR from emissions you're not taking any price risk (you do take smart contract risk instead)

I think this can help! but my concern is less so on the decentralization of different liquid staked eth providers and more concern on making the ETH more productive than just sitting in a smart contract so the yield can buy and burn MOR


[12/1/2023 12:33 PM] the77helios
I feel that.. 

On that note another pretty solid protocol that takes the stability of LSTs (through almost guaranteed arbitrage) to the next level is Cian.. they have leveraged staking vaults. Fully decentralized trading automations that deposits eth for a LST (liquid staking token), takes a flashloan out, deposits that as collateral for more LST.. to a pre-determined amount. Can be dialed to very safe.. and has auto-liquidation protection contracts in reverse incase of a depeg, can do everything in a single block. 

BUT that may be going a little too far for a core tokenomics. Their automative primitives are really top of class though, very under the radar atm. But I like the idea of just simply using an LST as is for less risk (preferably a minority one for the ethos lol)


[12/1/2023 12:35 PM] .rocky_c

Eigen layer will enable you to restake stETH so it may not be that complicated in the future and something that should definitely be looked at. 

Great work on the numbers, i was meaning to do something similar. 

The other point around the liquidity being low as a reason to boostrap the POL i think we need to assume that if the project is successful then liquidity will naturally come, if it isnt successful then liquidity isn't the main issue. Bittesnor for example was being traded OTC through Discord at the beginning when the FDV was into the hundreds of millions and still managed to come out of that. TLDR - this won't make or break a project if the demand is there. 

I do think using some emissions to incentivise liquidity however could be smart.

one thing that may marginally help in securing POL is to turn on a 5% deposit/withdraw fee for capital providers to supplement the stETH yield


[12/13/2023 7:35 AM] harveymilk
this would further align CPs with morpheus and offer a slight disincentive for mercenary liquidity miners


[12/13/2023 7:38 AM] harveymilk
if the protocol were to get 1000 stETH from capital providers it would only generate 12.5 eth over the 90 day period before token listing. even if all of that eth was paired with MOR, liquidity would essentially be nonexistent

In your theory, what is the best strategy to get more MOR? Is it buying on the market, providing capital, or mining? I think buying on the market gives you more coins at a fair value. You won't gain much from providing capital because yield is low. I'm not sure about mining.


[12/14/2023 12:53 AM] smartagents
Interesting thoughts. What I've seen historically is to get the most participation in any system one should have the lowest barriers. Famously Paypal made it easy for people to withdraw to the Bank at any time with no to low fees and as a result people just left their money on Paypal, because they could withdraw it at any time. So in this case if there is no lock up, there is no extra fee for deposit or withdraw (beyond normal gas fees) then people may be more likely just to leave their stETH in as they can withdraw. Best to not have any extra friction. It also reintroduces an unexpected behavior that the person who hasn't done a bunch of research might be suprized by.

It will be interesting to see how this balances out. In a perfectly efficient market the market price of the token should be very similar to the implied price for stETH capital contributions, but perhaps there will be a lag. Just like the implied price Bitcoin miners are paying lags the market price. We shall see.

I think that if there is a UI and launched on ETH mainnet as well as ARB it will have the most interaction, regardless of gas prices I think people still mainly interact on ETH and for those that care about Gas will interact on ARB, the act of bridging the tokens to ARB is enough of a barrier to keep some people out surprisingly

A dynamic withdrawal fee or flat withdrawal fee could help bootstrap. 

Have a set period of time say 20 weeks, withdrawal fee starts at say 2% and linearly decreases to the flat withdrawal fee. 

Anyone who withdraws pays a small fee to exit. Also incentivises people to lock up for longer.

Another idea, which I‚Äôve seen work on the past is to age in staking. For those that are long term believers and investors in Morpheus, this keeps them from unstaking for a day or two to do some leverage trade. While a lot of people have the intention to ‚Äúcome back‚Äù X% gets margin called and can‚Äôt.


[12/20/2023 12:26 AM] smartagents
All good points. Though I think maximum liquidity, least friction systems counter intuitively tend to be the most sticky because you aren't turning people away who didn't want a lock up and people aren't taking funds out because they "might" need them later. If you can deposits and withdraw at any time with no penalty that's the freest and most attractive system to me.

If by "Capital Provider tokens" you mean the MOR tokens earned by Capital Contributors providing stETH yield to the Morpheus Protocol Smart Contracts then yes. Its referred to as the Boot strapping period. 

Though to be clear the stETH people provide can be withdrawn at any time. There is no locking concept for the stETH, though all yield contributed is a one way transfer. See this part of the white paper.

The white paper talks about wanting to avoid the Zcash problem. If there were only a few tokens 1 day then the price discovery would be impossible. 90 days in 1,286,111 MOR are claimable at the beginning of day 91. Hopefully the price discovery is workable.

Assuming that a person provides 100stETH, the stake reward that can be obtained every day is 100USDT of stETH. Then 50USDT stETH will be swapped into MOR, and combined with the other 50U stETH to form LP and be stored in the MOR-stETH pool. The LP can be withdrawn 91 days after the mainnet goes online. Equal to buy MOR equivalent to half of my stake reward using stETH. Is this all the MOR I can get for providing stETH yield? Or in addition to this, I will receive additional MOR rewards, from 24% capital rewards,  in proportion to the funds.

What's the discussion around a initial staking cap for capital contribution during the bootstrapping period?


[12/25/2023 3:51 AM] smartagents
Good question. The paper describes it a bit differently. 

"All stETH yield earned from your deposit is converted into protocol-owned liquidity (PoL). The yield remains as PoL indefinitely, but you can withdraw your stETH whenever."

So someone puts 100 stETH into the Capital Provider Smart Contract for Morpheus. It yields 100 USDT of stETH in yield for example. 100% of the yield (all the 100 USDT worth of stETH) is contributed to the Protocol-Owned-Liquidity FOREVER. 

However the person can withdraw the stETH principle minus the yield whenever they want (day 91 in the case of the boot strapping period) or 24 hours + a few blocks, normally post boot strapping period.

All the MOR earned by the yield provider can be claimed by them whenever. All of this MOR is from the 24% Capital Provider emissions and the amount depends on how much of the yield was contributed during that time compared to everyone else. So if 1% of the yield came from this Capital Provider during this period, then 1% of the MOR emissions as part of the 24% MOR for Capital Providers rewareds would go to them.

[12/25/2023 5:51 AM] kei0513
Thank you.So the rewards for capital providers will follow Scenario B, where the MOR in POL will be there indefinitely, and I can claim MOR after the bootstrapping period from the 24% capital emissions. The MOR in the POL is bought from yield and is essentially supplied or initiated by the 4% security component.


[12/25/2023 6:31 AM] kei0513
And for the 90days bootstrapping period, no one in 4C can get or use MOR token? Does that mean the full utility or opreation of the Morpheus network will be live atfer 90days the mainnet being live?

For the first 90 days all 4 C's are earning MOR but yes its not sendable until the end of the boot strapping period. Yes that does imply some parts of the Morpheus Network won't be able to achieve full function until the end of the boot strapping period.

Instead of providing only the yield from your steth only can you provide both the yield and the steth you are providing towards pol so you are only claiming mor tokens, and in this case would u just be gettting yield in mor for as long as mor is paying rewards, and after 91 days your mor tokens are transferrable but principle gone becaue it was fully commited to pol?

Could anyone summarize the main topics that have been recently discussed here? Of course, only if someone makes themselves available... 

I was interested in the protocol, the fact that they talked about it being open source caught my attention. This gives me a feeling of transparency from the team and the search for cooperation with the community.

Seems to evolving that way (step by step). Mostly due to the Smart Contract devs having started their efforts focused on the Capital Provider contracts which the community has been testing. Makes sense as the Capital Provider offering yield via stETH is the most straight forward of the four proofs.

The Yellowstone paper gives a great blue print for working on the Compute Smart Contracts next. I'd expect those have to be written before the Community Builder contracts can be done. That would leave Code Providers to last. Its all open source so the more devs and testers that want to contribute the faster it will go.


[1/5/2024 9:25 AM] smartagents
Lots of discussions but outcomes that have changed the papers / smart contracts include.

1. Switch from Thorchain Saver vaults for yield to Lido stETH (due to current technical limitations with separating yield to multiple address on Thorchain). To be explored in the future to expand yield sources beyond Staked ETH.

2. Originally the Capital Contributors would offer yield (ETH) being used for buying then burning MOR. Instead after discussion Protocol Owned Liquidity was thought to provide more utility. So now, 50% of the yield is used to buy MOR and the other 50% of the stETH is kept as stETH. Both the MOR and stETH are kept in the AMM pool as Protocol Owned Liquidity, to increase liquidity over time.

3. Other upgrades include switching from Base, to Polygon, to Arbitrum for the 2nd layer as research showed the most stETH was available on Arbitrum.

But the protocol won't be functional if you deploy only 1 or 2 out of 4 main parts, right? I'm asking as saw estimates for the launch on late Jan, but taking into account information you shared, I'd say it's Q2-Q3 2024. 
Protocol is really complex, both technically and business logic wise, so it would make sense to have extensive testnet phase before going mainnet.


[1/5/2024 8:41 PM] antonb
> Other upgrades include switching from Base, to Polygon, to Arbitrum for the 2nd layer as research showed the most stETH was available on Arbitrum.

WP mentions ETH, Pol and Arb and it's unclear which one will be used. If Polygon is chosen, devs should make additional research for compatibility issues as Polygon PoS is going to merge with ZkEVM.
I can't say that availability of stETH on Arbitrum is a sufficient reason to choose it, as we are in multichain market and it's safe and cheap to bridge. I'd rather pay attention to scalability, speed, fees and technical side.

Morpheus' primary utility the simple ability to run an open source large language model for users went live with 0.0.1 in October (with Morpheus local version). Everything from there is an upgrade that extends those capabilities to remote / network context. People can and do use Morpheus right now.

Personally I'm a big advocate for incremental improvement. Make an improvement, ship it. Make another improvement ship it. Rather then waiting around some big release. Especially given how the Capital Smart Contracts need to proceed, the Compute ones, which need to proceed the Community Builder ones.


[1/5/2024 11:00 PM] smartagents
Enough developers felt strongly to start with Arbitrum, however I think everyone is open to any Ethereum Layer 2 as its easy to extend between Ethereum / layer 2s.

Coding hours will be live. Capital will be live. If Compute Smart Contract or Router or Community Smart Contract isn't ready after 90 days, then the MOR for those emissions rewards will just keep growing in the Smart Contract waiting for their launch. All part of the boot strapping process.

GM and sorry if this has been asked before. I searched for some terms but could not find the answer to my question:

The WP suggests that 51.444 MOR will be paired with whatever amount of yield from stETH contributions at Day 91 for POL?  Are those 51.444 token fixed at Day 91? At the same time 100% of the yield generated by capital providers would go towards POL and would be paired with said 51.444 MOR?

Is this correct or do I miss something here?


[1/18/2024 2:22 PM] antonb
Hey man. I'll try to address. 
These 51444 are taken from 4% daily emissions for protection fund and yes, they will be paired with stETH earned during bootstrapping period this way we will get initial listing price of MOR.


[1/18/2024 5:03 PM] bdog1741
Thx for clarifying. Just to make sure I have it right: From Day 91 onwards 50% of yield from stETH will go towards market buying MOR and will then be added with the other 50% of yield to POL, correct?

how frequently does stEth pay out it's yield?


[1/18/2024 5:16 PM] antonb
Is your question about LIDO or how frequently Morpheus going to deploy yield into LP?


[1/18/2024 5:17 PM] antonb
Anyway, in both cases the answer is daily)


[1/18/2024 5:18 PM] c0ax.
i'm a noob to all these things so i'm just trying to understand how the POL is working.


[1/18/2024 5:18 PM] c0ax.
So yield is paid out by LIDO and then the protocol uses that yield to buy MOR?


[1/18/2024 5:22 PM] smartagents
That is correct. 50% of the stETH yield is used by the protocol for buying MOR from the AMM and 50% stays as stETH in the AMM. Any LP returns from the pool that go to the Protocol are re-added to the Protocol Owned Liquidity.


[1/18/2024 5:24 PM] antonb
PoL can work differently in each project, but what they have in common is that liquidity is owned by protocol (DAO/smart contract) in contrast to cases where liquidity belongs to users.


[1/18/2024 6:04 PM] c0ax.
So when I buy stEth and want to earn MOR I can stake it in the MOR pool and it will reward me MOR?


[1/18/2024 6:09 PM] c0ax.
When the protocol buys 50% MOR from the AMM is this MOR burnt or stored in the LP?


[1/18/2024 8:13 PM] antonb
You definitely can, as AMM is permissionless, but the only way to get MOR rewards is to deposit stETH on Ethereum network.


[1/18/2024 8:15 PM] antonb
This MOR is paired with another 50% of yield generated by stETH and provided into AMM (DEX) liquidity pool, thus creating protocol owned liquidity


[1/18/2024 10:17 PM] erikvoorhees
You stake the stETH *not* in the MOR pool. Rather, you stake it in the "Capital Contract" (this is currently in testnet). When stETH is in the Capital Contract, the yield from the stETH is donated to the protocol. And in return for you giving up this yield for the duration of your deposit, you're credited with MOR (pro-rata relative to all other depositors). 

Anyone can separately deposit stETH/MOR in the liquidity pool and earn trade fees just like any other liquidity pool, but this is a separate thing.


[1/18/2024 10:29 PM] erikvoorhees
It's stored in the LP

Assume 1 stETH of yeild is earned by the protocol, then:

0.5 stETH is traded for MOR
0.5 stETH remains 

The 50% MOR + 50% stETH then live indefinitely in the liqudiity pool, owned by the protocol, and earning fees. 

Benefits:
1)  Provides a constant source of demand for MOR 
2) Provides liquidity for the ETH/MOR trade paid, making MOR a more liquidity asset 

Both 1 & 2 will be small effects at first, and grow over the long term as the protocol owned liquidity grows.

üî• 

[1/18/2024 11:38 PM] c0ax.
The Protocol Owned Liquidity is separate from the uniswap LP?  Or are they the same thing?


[1/18/2024 11:41 PM] smartagents
The yield contributed by Capital Providers through the Capital Smart Contract both buys MOR and adds stETH to the AMM as an LP as Erik mentions above. This is the "Protocol Owned Liquidity". For contributing this yield Capital Providers earn part of the 24% of MOR emissions pro-rata to their contribution.

The fact that anyone can provide MOR or stETH to the pool and earn LP fees is seperate and does not earn any of the MOR emissions from the protocol.


[1/18/2024 11:45 PM] c0ax.
We earn MOR emission through the Capital Smart Contract once we provide our stETH.   But earn transaction fees if just using regular LP?

{Reactions}
üëçüèº 

[1/18/2024 11:46 PM] smartagents
Correct. If by "transaction fees" you mean normal Uniswap type LP fees for adding tokens to a pool, then yes.


[1/18/2024 11:47 PM] c0ax.
The longer we keep our stETH locked up in the Capital Smart Contract the longer we earn emissions, is that also correct?


[1/18/2024 11:55 PM] smartagents
Yes. As the stETH "rebases" once per day and that is the "yeild" that gets contributed to the Morpheus Protocol.


[1/18/2024 11:55 PM] smartagents
So every day longer you keep the stETH in the Capital Contract gets you additional MOR emissions.

I'd suggest reading WP part called "Code Proof, Registration & Reward" where you can find detailed explanation, but the short answer is that they got the same 24% of daily emissions distributed proportionally to time contributed.

You can withdraw deposited stETH anytime it's not locked, but will only reward you with MOR tokens when deposited.

The distribution will start with all four groups earning the tokens by providing forms of proof of work (labor) and proof of Stake (capital) to the network. No pre-mine. No early token sale.

Potentially there will be 1,286,111 MOR claimable at the beginning of day 91. The initial price depends on yield generated from provided capital which is going to be paired with 51,444 MOR dedicated to the protection funds, but leveraged for bootstrapping purpose.

gmgm interesting project! Question on the bootstapping event. Will MOR emissions be proportional to stETH provided with no total cap?


[1/20/2024 8:43 PM] antonb
Do you mean the total cap of stETH one can provide?


[1/20/2024 8:44 PM] elgent00
At an individual level and in total across all capital providers. Does it effectively operate like normal LP rewards - emissions proportional to % of LP


[1/20/2024 9:26 PM] antonb
There is no total cap, but the minimum stETH amount to deposit is 0.01. 
Here is the quote from the WP:
> Capital Provider will receive MOR tokens each day in pro-rata to their total stETH yield contributed. For example, if there are 100 Capital Providers who each contributed 1 stETH of yield on day 1 when the network launches, then each one gets 1% of the 3,456 MOR tokens each day = 34.56 MOR.

on 8th feb, you can stake your steth with the protocol and earn rewards in mor tokens for those 90 days


[1/23/2024 11:02 PM] smartagents
OTC is a regulated activity in most countries. 
So I can confidently say there is a ZERO % chance of a future OTC channel on this Discord : )
And honestly if the Uniswap pool is liquid and going ever more liquid then I don't think an OTC will be critical. There is no pre-mine or other team tokens to sell in batches when it comes to Morpheus. Only the tokens we all fairly earn from day 1.

L2s are great, hard to go back after using them with the low fees


[1/24/2024 2:02 AM] mahalleinirx
I think the main reason the choice was made was because the people buying beyond speculation are not used to paying $5 in gas or more,  they simply wouldn't use it in that case, while speculators are normally happy to pay that. That's why both are considered.


[1/24/2024 2:14 AM] smartagents
Agreed. I think both would be good. Different use cases. Capital Providers are likely less fee sensitive and end users much more fee sensitive. So having an ETH / MOR pool on layer 1 and a stETH / MOR pool on Arbitrum make sense.

I do as well. It's a great way to bootstrap. I just wasn't sure if any of the wider adoption of the TCM model may theoretically flow back to MOR, either directly in the form of token utility, or tooling that uses MOR.


[1/31/2024 11:33 PM] moonlander00
Since it's open source, there's nothing stopping me from running a TCM launch with steth and "newcoin". In that arrangement, does MOR (token) or Morpheus as a network benefit? I'm a big fan of open source and opposed to value capture bottlenecks for their own sake, I just couldn't tell in the readme docs if there was a logical value capture point the for MOR and thinking I may have missed something.


[1/31/2024 11:42 PM] antonb
Got your point. You're right, nothing can stop someone to fork, and that's perfectly OK. 
In my opinion, the first projects to adopt the model will be those from the Morpheus ecosystem. Each of them will utilize Morpheus resources, thereby adding  value for everyone, creating demand for MOR, and fostering network effects growth.

TCM will work by allowing people to be able to direct which opensource project launching with the TCM model to send their yield to, tokenomics remain the same but allocated differently depending on the person running the repo through atomic governance

I don't understand why I should provide capital if I can't calculate how many Mor I will receive... I could provide $10,000 of capital and literally earn $200 worth of Mor after 3 months and it's not worth it because I could earn more by simply betting on eth.  what am I doing wrong?


[2/1/2024 4:37 AM] smartagents
Well. A couple of things here. You understand that you keep your ETH right? The Morpheus Smart Contracts only collect the yield, not your principle. You can "bet on ETH" by holding your Staked ETH (stETH) in the Morpheus contract AND collect the MOR tokens you earned for contributing the yield. When ever you want to withdraw the stETH hit the withdraw button. Then hit the "claim" button to get your MOR you earned.

Contribute Code or Contribute stETH yield are phase one. And you can only claim them day 91 at the end of the boot strapping process. There is no token sale, no team, no company, no pre-mine so yeah everyone has to earn their MOR one way or another.

Beginning of day 91 there will be 1,286,111 MOR emitted. Though only 52% those will be claimable for Code (24%) + Capital Contributors (24%) + Protection Fund (4%).

Also, the whitepaper says "It's important that at the beginning liquid resources such as ETH are used to pay devs and for equipment." - where is the ETH coming from? Given that capital providers don't actually transfer the principal, just the yield, and the yield is only being automatically transferred the stETH/MOR liquidity pool.

> All projects go through phases of development. It's important that at the beginning *liquid resources such as ETH are used to pay devs and for equipment.* Ethereum did the same thing when they leveraged BTC from their community to pay for the initial coding of their blockchain. The difference here is that the Smart Agent Protocol has already been developed and Morpheus is implementing a version to broaden its reach, so there isn't a need for a crowd sale before the project goes live. MOR tokens will only be rewarded after the software is live.

and is the allocation computed on a daily basis, or over the entire period? for example, if day one there is just one capital provider with 1E, does that provider get 3456 $mor for the first day? or is it per-block, or something else?

I asked in general but this may be a better place for the question...

Is there a vesting schedule for our accrued $mor? If so, what is it as I couldn't find it in the docs.


[2/8/2024 4:52 PM] mahalleinirx
90 days


[2/8/2024 4:53 PM] mahalleinirx
After that 90 days it is a 7 day lockup and you can claim


[2/8/2024 5:02 PM] max180y
That isn't right. Starting today, there's is a 90 day period during which we can earn mor by staking stEth (stEth is locked for 7 days from deposit but can be withdrawn any time after 7 days from deposit). On day 91 we can claim our earned mor. What I'm asking is whether we can claim all of our earned mor on day 91 or is there a vesting schedule (which would be sensible to protect against whales dumping).


[2/8/2024 5:22 PM] antonb
No vesting plans, you'll be able to claim the whole amount

any insights on roughly how much mor one could get after 90days on staking .35E?

you can try some math in #üí≠Ô∏±price-talk .. but really until staking levels out and a few weeks of emissions goes by no real data to be used for it

In short, you can deposit stETH and get rewarded in MOR tokens. Your deposit is locked for the first 7 days and tiken is claimable after 90 days (~may 9th)

Hi folks, I like the project but help me understand how there's no pre-sale of tokens when you can stake Eth and get the token as a reward before net is live. Isn't that a roundabout way of doing a pre-sale?


[2/12/2024 9:56 PM] antonb
Hi. Sale usually means you pay money and get something in exchange.
Morpheus is different, you buy nothing, but contribute either capital or code, compute, apps and rewarded with MOR tokens for that.


[2/12/2024 10:04 PM] nullhypothesisnakamoto
I understand you don't pay for the tokens. How many tokens will be issued to capital contributors before the net goes live?


[2/12/2024 10:05 PM] antonb
Around ~320k MOR  for Capital Providers, which is 50% of all claimable MOR on the launch day.

One more thing and apologies if this is too basic. I'm a noob when it comes to staking and smart contracts. MetaMask is warning me that the contract can spend all my Eth. I thought the contract can only spend the stake reward Eth. Where can I see the contract code?


[2/12/2024 10:37 PM] antonb
The contract can only spend the amount you approved (if you need, can send you a screenshot). If you approve something like 2342042930592503, yeah, it's definitely all of your funds, but the best cybersec practices teach us to approve only amount you want to spend.

So I can put 0 and would still get the MOR rewards, right?


[2/12/2024 10:39 PM] antonb
Not, as with 0 you can only deposit 0 stETH and get 0 rewards.


[2/12/2024 10:40 PM] nullhypothesisnakamoto
For example, I want to put 5 Eth into the contract, I would have to allow the contract to spend the 5 Eth to get the MOR rewards,


[2/12/2024 10:41 PM] antonb
Correct, after approval tx you'll have to sign another that will send these 5ETH to the contract.
When 2nd tx in confirmed you'll start enjoying your rewards.


[2/12/2024 10:43 PM] nullhypothesisnakamoto
Is there anything in the smart contract code that says the transferred Eth will not be spent and only the rewards?


[2/12/2024 10:49 PM] antonb
It's a bit more complicated logic than that, but in common cased contract and funds in it are managed by admin keys, in Morpheus we have multi signature contract management (4 our of 7), that means in order to do any actions with contract, 4 people should sign the tx. Also the contract passed 3 tier of cybersecurity audit as security of users' funds is top priority. 
Here is the announcement about multisig setup

I like to see if I understand this correctly. If someone creates an app/smart AI agent on morhpeus which will use the compute power of Morpheus, then every inquiry made through the app will require a fee to process the request? the compute power needed for such requests/usage could not be free if the app ends up making 1000's of requests every hour. right?


[2/14/2024 4:30 AM] smartagents
Depends a few variables.
If the users has the local download they might not need any network compute.
If the user hold MOR tokens then they have a right to a pro-rata amount of network compute (no transaction required just checking the connected address has a balance).

@SmartAgents would the current tokenomics make sense with massive adoptions in long term with people/ smart AI agents making /requesting billions of inputs/transactions, with price of MOR constantly fluctuating? or that would not matter based on what you just said (as long as they hold MOR tokens in their wallet they can use the network pro-rata)


[2/14/2024 4:33 AM] smartagents
We shall see. The way the Compute is designed there will be likely be an excess in Compute resources available, given not everyone will be claiming their usage each day for every MOR token.


[2/14/2024 4:53 AM] rumi4400
Thinking out loud here, would the massive yield generated on the steth by capital providers (long term, lets assume 100,000 steth held in the contract), then basically pay for the the support of all the network developments long term? and how would that correlate to the MOR price if Morpheus network is generating such an massive revenue from the yields?


[2/14/2024 6:37 AM] smartagents
Going to balance out with the Code, Compute, Community (Front End Builders) accessing liquidity.


[2/14/2024 11:49 AM] rumi4400
I understood the part where the 4 C's get paid in MOR equally based on the emission and their contribution. I was curious how would the continuous growing liquidity generated from the steth yield will affect the MOR  price? we are talking about over $8 million a month in yield revenue being added to the pool (assuming 100,000 steth @$10K each *top of the market*) . How is this liquidity being managed/ utilized?


[2/14/2024 1:33 PM] antonb
I can be wrong, but according to my calculations, even 100k stETH with 3,5% APR and $10k ETH price it's ~3mln/month

{Reactions}
üëè 

[2/14/2024 1:38 PM] antonb
I see it as each category of 4 C's play it's significant role in the ecosystem.
- Code builders provide technological basis
- Compute providers generates the main resource for AI
- Community builders build apps that have demand among users
and 
- Capital Providers  provide liquidity (like fuel) for the whole ecosystem


[2/14/2024 1:43 PM] antonb
> how would the continuous growing liquidity generated from the steth yield will affect the MOR  price?
Frankly, I haven't seen the situations when deep liquidity could hurt project somehow. Morpheus utilize the concept call Techno Capital Machine that also establish constant buy pressure for MOR token. 
So I'd say the logic is as follows: More capital => more liquidity => more buy pressure and more stable price => more interest to MOR


[2/14/2024 5:13 PM] vizor9
What's the total supply for MOR and what will the circ supply be at launch at day 91?


[2/14/2024 5:13 PM] antonb
42 mln / ~ 1,35mln


[2/14/2024 7:05 PM] spino15
i am moving my questions here as this seems more appropriate.
is it safe to assume that the initial MC will basically depend on the amount of stETH (and thus on the total yeld generated until then)?
are there any simulations for that?


[2/14/2024 7:09 PM] antonb
Initial MC depends on the initial MOR price, which in turn, depends on yield generated over 90 days of the bootstrapping period.


[2/14/2024 7:10 PM] antonb
51444 MOR from the protection fund emissions will be paired with yield and put into AMM.


[2/14/2024 7:11 PM] spino15
yeah, that is what i meant. MC should be the same as the generated yield basically, right?


[2/14/2024 7:12 PM] antonb
Here are some price assumptions
https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1199442547462914180/1205485295521501194


[2/14/2024 7:14 PM] antonb
Let's put it this way 
MC = circ supply * MOR price


[2/14/2024 7:17 PM] spino15
yeah, my bad. the generated yield will equal the value of MOR in the pool, not the total amount. ü§ù 
thanks, it is starting to make sense now.

[2/15/2024 2:31 AM] .aconchego
Guys, to be able to have some Mor, we have to deposit at least 1 steth, if my calcul is right with 1 steth in 90 days you earn around 5 MOR. Right?


[2/15/2024 2:50 AM] antonb
Can say that your calculations are correct)


[2/15/2024 3:21 AM] rotorrocket
There is a static amount of MOR distributed each day. As more stETH are staked, your allocation becomes more diluted, reducing your earnings.   That's how I understand it.


[2/15/2024 3:24 AM] smartagents
There is increasingly competition for MOR for sure.
Though interestingly because of the stETH yield model used by Morpheus the amount of value being put into the Protocol Owned Liquidity balances out. Meaning every stETH added, also adds more stETH yield. So more demand for the MOR tokens. So while there is "dilution" in the sense of more competition for each MOR, there is also more stETH yield that will go toward buying the same number of MOR tokens.

üëÜ ‚úÖ (3) üß† 

[2/15/2024 3:45 AM] rumi4400
so more yield added to the pool = more steth swapped for MOR = more buying pressure on MOR price. How would this effect the to utility of MOR token in cases where it is used to pay for any of the many possible requests usage of the apps / platform? Specially, when after you pay for it with MOR then say the price jumps 10% or something higher? Wouldn't this create friction for day to day users (not MOR hodlers) doing lots of transactions?


[2/15/2024 4:32 AM] drobk
Hi how does morpheus take the yield from a rebasing token (stETH). Lido staked ether accrue in value daily but if i stake it on morpheus how come i'm able to withdraw the same amount i staked if morpheus is taking the yield ?


[2/15/2024 4:41 AM] 1272
"initially hold 1 stETH and your share of stETH on Lido gets you 0.1 ETH in rewards over time, your balance would be expected to update to show that you hold 1.1 stETH"


[2/15/2024 4:42 AM] salwilliam
a futures market could help alleviate that friction


[2/15/2024 4:44 AM] drobk
ok i always tought the value of stETH was increasing not the amount of token


[2/15/2024 8:10 AM] smartagents
Rebasing Lido style increases the number of stETH I believe. There are other staked tokens that increase the value per token instead.

IF we go live at 100m market cap (which is high), then I'll receive $6600, for staking $30 000 for 90 days. That's messed up tbh


[2/16/2024 3:12 AM] antonb
Fair launch means equal conditions for everyone, you get exactly the same what you've contributed. I can't state it's unfair when someone has more ETH than you.


[2/16/2024 3:12 AM] vizor9
Stage 1: Denial

Whales manipulated it, they took loans to soak up supply. You can't tell me there is anything fair about this launch, you'll come around when you realize how dumb it is.


[2/16/2024 3:12 AM] antonb
Moreover, you might be surprized, but you'll get the same value as "whales"

[2/16/2024 3:16 AM] vizor9
Alright I read it, so you truly are delusional then. Whales bidding $160m is good in your mind, since there will be more demand then in the long run. Enjoy your 50k bag if we hit 10B then

Morpheus isn't type of project you used to see on market. It's pioneering the  concept called Techo Capital Machine. Every stETH that comes dilutes the MOR rewards, but at the same time makes MOR more valuable as contributes to liquidity creation.


[2/16/2024 3:16 AM] koreep
$1mm in risk vs. $1,000


[2/16/2024 3:17 AM] vizor9
Higher Liquidity doesn't equal Higher Value that's where you're wrong

Not sure what u r looking for.


[2/16/2024 3:18 AM] vizor9
Let me explain:

If you buy something that is "under the radar" or "early" even at "Launch", would you prefer buying it at 5,000,000 market cap (which is moderately high for a FAIR LAUNCH) or would you buy it at 30m? Which is high as hell, but technically in this case that's exactly what we did


[2/16/2024 3:18 AM] antonb
Okay. Let's try this way. Please explain, how would you organize launch that will be truly "fair"?


[2/16/2024 3:18 AM] vizor9
Early contributors get early entries


[2/16/2024 3:18 AM] vizor9
look at TAO


[2/16/2024 3:19 AM] vizor9
let me correct 300m not 30m


[2/16/2024 3:19 AM] vizor9
It's fair that early contributors and people who found this when it was under the radar got an entry at 300m market cap on average


[2/16/2024 3:19 AM] vizor9
Since 30 000$ equals 0,01% xD


[2/16/2024 3:20 AM] vizor9
How can you not see what I'm trying to say


[2/16/2024 3:20 AM] antonb
So you propose to disadvantage one group over another and call that fair?


[2/16/2024 3:21 AM] vizor9
Idgaf about other people, I'm here for money. If you're here for the tech you're ngmi, enjoy your burger money


[2/16/2024 3:23 AM] antonb
So that's the problem, not the launch itself.
You have no reason to be angry, you got the same value as whales, but according to your share of contribution.

Nah bro..

If 1MOR = $10.. with 50k staked.. let‚Äôs say you put in enough for $200 = 20MOR

If 1MOR = $50 (meaning more yield is being generated, meaning more stETH being paired in the AMM) with 250k staked‚Ä¶ you stake enough for 5MOR‚Ä¶ you still made $200


[2/16/2024 3:49 AM] the77helios
The more that is staked, the higher the value of 1 MOR, yet the same dollar value of your personal yield (even though amount of MOR token is low, each token is worth more)

People can't expect to buy up a bunch of tokens early and then just dump for a big profit in the short time. That's a good thing. The investors are thinking long-term. They actually want to build. Low time preference. A lot of wisdom from the past 15 years of crypto is coalescing in this project's tokenomics imho.

Is the only way to generate MOR tokens currently by staking, and the other methods become available at launch?


[2/16/2024 4:20 AM] antonb
You can provide Code to the Morpheus GitHub as well. Compute will be available in Phase 2 (~May) and Community builder reawards in Phase 3 (~July)


[2/16/2024 4:23 AM] aic0929
MOR is being given for code contributions right now? Just trying to wrap my head around this and how many tokens might be circulating on May 8th


[2/16/2024 4:28 AM] smartagents
Morpheus isn't a token sale. This isn't a one time event. 

@Botanic has the correct take.
Every single stETH deposited is adding more value to the Protocol over time.

So regardless of if 100 stETH, 1,000 stETH, 10,000 stETH, 100,000 stETH are deposited, they all add value to the protocol in proportion and add more demand to buy the MOR tokens. Every single day.

#1. For example say only 100 stETH was deposited, that would only be 3.3 stETH per year added to liquidity and demand for MOR.

#2. For example say 100,000 stETH are deposited, that would be 3,300 stETH per year added to liquidity and demand for MOR.

Yes everyone earns 1,000X less MOR in the second example, but there is now 1,000X more demand for MOR than the first case.

But why would others join in, if it wasn't public and fair launched.
People want to have their cake and eat it too. It doesn't work like that.
If you just want to get some special access then Morpheus isn't the project for you.
This is a project for those that want open source, built in public from day 1.

All good. The total deposit number was still interesting. So basically 80K + deposited minus currently staked stETH of 77,377 means people have only withdrawn about 3k stETH. It will be interesting to see how these flows continue to adjust over time. Anyone past day 14 for example will have added their stETH AFTER the withdraws were already demonstrated on mainnet.

[2/20/2024 7:23 AM] smartagents
That is correct. Though there are transactions if an Inference user doesn't hold enough MOR to access the amount of Compute they want to use. For example say someone wants to do some Model training (which uses a lot of Compute at one time). They might not have enough MOR, so they can buy and pay MOR as fees to Compute Providers.

Paying for Smart Agents is the other big one. As people release specialized Smart Agents on Morpheus they can choose how they are paid for and the default will of course be to pay in MOR.

By ‚Äúprincipal is always yours‚Äù you mean initial token value or token quantity?


[2/21/2024 2:12 AM] hscwk
Of stETH


[2/21/2024 2:12 AM] antonb
Yes, you can always withdraw the same amount you deposited.


[2/21/2024 2:12 AM] antonb
Correct, stETH on Eth mainnet


[2/21/2024 2:14 AM] antonb
Now we are at the bootstrapping period, when protocol accumulates stETH yield to put it with MOR into Uniswap Arbitrum on May 8th.
After initial liquidity is created, Morpheus will periodically use 50% of the generated yield to buy MOR from market and add it to LP with the remaining 50% of the yield.


[2/21/2024 2:15 AM] antonb
I'd kindly ask you to have a look at #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs it would address most of possible questions


[2/21/2024 2:16 AM] hscwk
Same amount in an impermanent loss could be less token quantity than originally deposited especially if MOR token price increases. Yes I get my initial deposit back (say $3000 = 1 stETH). Upon withdrawal/in staking if MOR price is higher than when I staked, I may still get $3000 but that could be 0.95 ETH depending on stETH / MOR LP pair


[2/21/2024 2:18 AM] antonb
The deposits that rewarded in MOR tokens are only those you make on Morpheus website. It's only one asset - stETH, no IL implied.


[2/21/2024 2:18 AM] antonb
It has zero connection with MOR price


[2/21/2024 2:20 AM] hscwk
Ok. Appreciate the clarification.

One last thing. MOR public transferable window is 90 days from Feb 8th? So I can stake stETH during the non transferable window to accrue MOR tokens at which point . At end of that period I can unstake stETH and keep my MOR tokens?


[2/21/2024 2:27 AM] hscwk
And to estimate number of MOR tokens rewarded: number of stETH I deposit / total deposit) * daily MOR rewards * number of days


[2/21/2024 2:27 AM] antonb
Your rewards start accrue from the moment you deposited and will become claimable/sendable/tradable on May 8th. 
After that day you can withdraw your deposit or keep it and continue getting MOR rewards.
Here is calculator that help you get estimates of rewards based on currently deposited stETH amount https://morstats.info/staked_eth/

"There will be 668,778 total MOR tokens in circulation on day 90. Capital + Code + Protection Fund MOR tokens emitted."

I understand this but where is the 1,286,112 coming from in the mor.org about document, is this counting the "soft-locked" community supply + code supply that have to be voted into circulation from governance?


[2/26/2024 10:53 AM] _0xbenjamin_
if Cumulative Capital supply is only 308,667 + 51,444  Protection fund on May 7, where is the other  308,667 coming from exactly?

Do I understand correct that Capital Provider locks his stETH and all of the yield part (currently about 3%) goes to Morpheus. 50% of the 3% yield goes into Liquidity Provider and the other 50% goes into PoL (protocol owned liquidity). 

So in essence the capital provider is forfaiting all his stETH yield to morpheus.

From homepage:

"The definition of a Capital Provider is someone who has downloaded the full node and connected their wallet and locked at least 0.01 ETH in a yielding smart contract. This Capital Provider Smart Contract will provide 50% of the stETH yield produced to the Morpheus swap function. The swap buys the MOR tokens from an Automated Market Maker (AMM) and then locks it into a Liquidity Provider of those MOR tokens. This will provide liquidity to all those coders, community members and compute providers seeking a buyer.
 

As a result, the Capital Provider will receive MOR tokens each day in pro-rata to their total ETH yield contributed. For example, if there are 100 Capital Providers who each contributed 1 ETH on day 1 when the network launches, then each one gets 1% of the 3,456 MOR tokens each day = 34.56 MOR.
 

All stETH yield earned from your deposit is converted into protocol-owned liquidity (PoL). The yield remains as PoL indefinitely, but you can withdraw your stETH whenever."

i think one thing the mor ai economy should consider adding would be an ecosystem grants dao, since building more value add features are likely to have higher upfront costs, since investments in the right areas for protocol growth could have significant value add, that may not have had a chance to occur. Eg like ethereum foundation grants program

ello, guys
I'm Neil from Hotcoin Global, the top30 CEX.

May I know who is the responsible person to talk with?
Thank you very much!!


[3/5/2024 9:41 PM] antonb
Hello Neil. As Morpheus is solely owned and driven by community of open source contributors, there are no team, founders, registered entity or person you can talk to about listing.
To list MOR you don't need permission from anyone.


[3/5/2024 11:55 PM] aquila9r
I'm a super tokenomics newb so if this is obvious please lmk, but is there a brief answer to why the network needs its own token instead of just using ETH?


[3/6/2024 12:11 AM] antonb
Interesting question. You can't implement features and economic incentives planned in Morpheus without the native token.


[3/6/2024 1:45 AM] aquila9r
Yeah but that begs the question why do the features and economic incentives require a native token? I'm just always instantly suspicious of any project that relies on its own token and didn't immediately see an explanation for why its required.


[3/6/2024 2:45 AM] antonb
There is also another question that became relevant lately "Why does a project need their own roll-up?")


[3/6/2024 2:47 AM] antonb
Let's be honest, in most cases token needs for fundraising, which is not a case for Morpheus as there is no team or investors tokens.

Are there any ideas to prevent snipers when $MOR will be launched in May?

There will be no snipes as Arbitrum has no mempool and includes txs on FCFS basis.

How to earn more MOR?


[3/17/2024 12:08 PM] antonb
The most obvious answer is to deposit more stETH or provide more code to the Morpheus GitHub.


[3/17/2024 10:08 PM] skyguy24
Is there any plans to reward early stakers with a multiplier or bonus to incentivize long term staking?


[3/17/2024 10:13 PM] antonb
No such plans, as emissions are hard coded in protocol and there is no incentive or marketing allocations as it's fair launch.

Can someone clarify the current emissions for me? Since we are pre launch are the current emissions per day 3456 or 14,400? I know that ETH stakers are getting emissions right now but is anyone else?


[3/18/2024 4:18 AM] antonb
Hi. The answer is in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day and decline by 2.468994701 MOR each day until the reward reaches 0 on day 5,833  (~16 years).
3,456 MOR per day for Capital Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Code Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Compute Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Community Providers.


[3/18/2024 4:24 AM] antonb
> I know that ETH stakers are getting emissions right now but is anyone else?
The emissions for all 4 groups of contributors started on the 8th of February, but only Capital and Code providers will be claimable after the bootstrapping period  on May 8th (~640k MOR).  Compute and Community frontend builders  rewards will go live at the later phases.

[3/25/2024 12:43 PM] antonb
On day 88th only protection fund tokens will be available for claim, which will be used for liquidity pool creation at the same moment when MOR becomes claimable.


[3/25/2024 5:25 PM] lemonflex
So trading won‚Äôt be live until day 90?


[3/25/2024 5:29 PM] antonb
Yes. On the 8th of May MOR token rewards are going to be claimable for capital and code contributors. The same date AMM liquidity is deployed so it's safe to say that MOR token go live and be sendable/tradable.

[4/1/2024 3:05 PM] antonb
Circulation supply is defined by the amount of tokens claimed by contributors, as only capital and code rewards are live now, ~640k MOR will be potentially claimable.


[4/1/2024 3:07 PM] antonb
Not this straightforward as this causes risks, but the general concept is correct.

Yes, they look into the contract and get information about factual token circulation.


[4/1/2024 10:57 PM] smartagents
It will be interesting to see their view of the Smart Contracts, because all those Compute / Community MOR tokens will exist, just being held in reserve until they can be claimed by builders. I feel the more circulation the better, so there is better price discovery.


[4/1/2024 11:43 PM] antonb
**This is from Coingecko methodology about circulating supply:**
For tokens issued on smart contract platforms (eg. ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum), we calculate the Circulating Supply by deducting locked tokens from Total Supply. Locked tokens may include Foundation‚Äôs Fund, investors‚Äô locked tokens, team‚Äôs locked tokens etc. The addresses of these locked tokens are obtained from the token teams.

**Coinmarketcap:**
Assets that are locked (via smart contracts or legal contracts), allocated to insiders (e.g. teams or private investors), or *not sellable on the public market* are generally not regarded as circulating, regardless of whether they are unlocked.

[4/2/2024 12:48 AM] antonb
As freeman explained, Morpheus uses fair launch approach, which implies there is no presale, premine, allocations, whitelists, team tokens, etc. 
Until the moment MOR token is live on May 8th, you can only earn it by providing capital in form of the stETH or code to Morpheus repository.
All the basics are covered in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

That would roughly be 3424.0018 (daily emission today) * 90 (launch duration)  MOR tokens in circulation at day 0. 

Please correct me if i'm wrong.

Could you please elaborate how you calculated this number?


[4/4/2024 1:05 AM] antonb
If we take the following conditions:
- 55 days passed from the launch
- 105k stETH is the average deposited amount
- 3,3% is the average Lido APY
we have accurately the same ~522 stETH in yield as contract indicates

Hello, everyone. I'm new here.

Can you explain in a simple way the relationship between how much is deposited and how much this deposit will correspond to in the amount of MOR tokens?

For example, I deposited one stETH, how much will I receive in MOR?

The concept is simple. There are daily emissions for capital providers, which are proportionally distributed among users deposited stETH.


[4/5/2024 12:16 AM] ayr5079
Ok, distributed daily. But in what proportion?


[4/5/2024 12:17 AM] ayr5079
Can you explain the logic to me?


[4/5/2024 12:17 AM] antonb
42 Million MOR is the max supply that will ever exist.
Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day and decreases to 0 per day by year 16.

3,456 MOR per day for Capital Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Code Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Compute Providers.
3,456 MOR per day for Community Providers.

It's everything is in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs


[4/5/2024 12:19 AM] antonb
In proportions it looks like:
24% for Capital Providers.
24% for Code Providers.
24% for Compute Providers.
24% for Community Providers.
5% for Protection Fund


[4/5/2024 12:20 AM] antonb
No problem, if you can point out specific logic that is unclear for you


[4/5/2024 1:03 AM] nyan_ng92
Compute Provider is place in phase 2 right ?
So when will phase 2 start ?

So how many MOR there will be in circulation at TGE? 14,400 or more?


[4/6/2024 3:58 AM] smartagents
TGE? Token Generation Event?
Morpheus is fair launched. MOR are emitted everyday since February 8th.
See numbers above. Day 90 when the MOR become claimable there will be 600,000+ MOR in existence earned by Code and Capital Providers.


[4/6/2024 7:44 AM] kainan_e
I'm seeing a total circulating supply of 831,119 30 mins ago and now 845376 MOR on https://morstats.info/ . My guess is it updates 1x per day and i just ran into the update time. 

Currently there are total deposits of 121927.097 stETH generating 3422.2 MOR per day.

so to earn 1 MOR per day you would currently need 35.6 stETH

35.6stETH earns 0.003229 ETH per day or $10.73

so currently the "cost" of purchasing MOR is $10.73 per MOR if acquired by sacrificing ETH stake rewards, but to earn that you'd need 120k$~ worth of eth.

That sounds about right on the estimate.
Though the true circulating number of MOR is a bit lower since only the Code and Capital MOR rewards will be claimable May 8th.
As the Compute and Community Smart Contracts are storing the MOR emitted for those buckets until Phase 2 and Phase 3 come online and Compute and Community builders can compete to earn those MOR.

Hi @Kainan!
I think that more correct definition would be "total emitted" MOR as tokens are not circulating yet. The website updates once a day, but the emissions happen with every block.

Being open source it depends on the developers. I see there is a first draft of the Smart Contracts being coded up. They will need to spend about 45 days on the testnet. So figure mid January for mainnet would be a best guess.

one has over a quarter million worth of wstETH, the other has less than 15 mil worth... just tells you a lot IMO about where it will be easiest to attract staked eth


[11/22/2023 1:27 AM] smartagents
The challenge with wstETH is it increases in value instead of re-basing.


[11/22/2023 1:27 AM] smartagents
One of the things I love about Morpheus is the whole thing where the users keeps their principal and contributes only the yield.


[11/22/2023 1:28 AM] smartagents
Hard to do that with wstETH, but easy to do that with stETH.


[11/22/2023 1:28 AM] smartagents
Talking to smart contract folks seems like might have to be on Ethereum and mint on Polygon. We shall see.


[11/22/2023 1:28 AM] jonisjon
I don't think steth can be bridged to l2?


[11/22/2023 1:29 AM] smartagents
Correct.


[11/22/2023 1:29 AM] smartagents
So if stETH is used it would have to be on L1.


[11/22/2023 1:29 AM] jonisjon
i mean... "technically" if you were using wstETH on a L2 they can still keep their principal etc


[11/22/2023 1:30 AM] jonisjon
in fact you can abstract this away from the user, they deposit ETH and its converted into wstETH behind the scenes, when they withdraw back to ETH etc


[11/22/2023 1:30 AM] jonisjon
so from the users perspective they get back their principal exactly what they put in, but the system can use wstETH which is the most liquid LST on L2s by far

So is the purpose of providing ETH purely so the yield is used to buy and burn MOR as a means of creating demand and being deflationary?

i am also interested in providing eth

I'm kind of confused about the MOR emissions for capital (ETH) if this is an okay venue to ask this in:

MOR is distributed to lst eth contributors. The yield that the lst creates is then used to buy MOR on an AMM and then that MOR is burned. Why is the MOR that eth yield buys burned? 

Wouldn't it be better to either 1) use ~half of the eth yield to buy MOR and keep the other half as ETH and LP into an AMM and have the DAO own/lock that liquidity? or 2) use it to fund development?

I get that this burn is meant to put a deflationary mechanism for MOR but what's the point of even emitting this portion of MOR then? Just putting ETH into a contract doesn't seem to do much if it's only used to buy and burn MOR (likely there will be more MOR distributed/emitted than MOR bought and burned w yield, so it's net inflationary)

That's the way I think about it. Those providing stETH yield are adding liquidity to the Morpheus contributors and thus boot strapping the functions and utility of the network

Adding liquidity in the sense they are buying the token in the AMM? 

It‚Äôs an interesting concept but you are emitting and paying capital providers MOR in order to buy less MOR so the net result is more supply vs demand? 

Keen to hear the thought process behind it, is it as a way to try and draw in more people and make accumulating MOR easy and accessible vs having to provide compute and thus a way to grow the community?

guys when will this whole process start? Node running starts at the same time as capital providing in ETH?


[12/14/2023 12:46 AM] smartagents
The paper says there is a boot strapping period. So yeah running nodes should kick off at the same time as the stETH mainnet. We shall see. It all depends on the open source devs. Needs to see each piece get built out.


[12/14/2023 1:13 AM] migenet
q1 2024?


[12/14/2023 1:15 AM] smartagents
Depends on the testing. Lets say 30 days is reasonable. Make sure everything on the Smart Contracts is good, it gets an audit, that would put it into some time in January for the Mainnet. That begins the boot strapping period which is 90 days where tokens are earned but not sendable until say some time in April. Again no magic dates. The faster we all test, the faster we know : )

@Kehndry 
1) The user tried to contribute to a pool that does not exist.
2) Before contributing, the user needs to give the distribution contract an "approve" that it will be able to transfer the user's funds.
Example: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x1643E812aE58766192Cf7D2Cf9567dF2C37e9B7F#writeProxyContract

might even make sense to have a audit competition for the smart contracts (something like C4) rather than just a single audit before launch IMO if that is possible

[12/14/2023 6:03 AM] jonisjon
those tend to be way better than any single auditor now-a-days and I would rather see the protocol take a little longer to launch but launch safely as possible vs rushing out a launch in 30 days personally

Ok guys I figured it out. 

For the Approval step instructions say "enter your address in the _spender (address) field" when actually you need to enter the Morpheus SC address. That's what caused the huge gas fee + rejection of the tx at the next step.

With that said, if you were to test the Smart Contract, find a bug, improve the guide, or otherwise do something of value you can submit a Pull Request in the Coding - Proof of Contribution list on Github and ask to get credited for a few hours of work.

Cool. All good. Thanks. Just a lot of people asking. Some protocols reward mainnet tokens to testnet folks so its a reasonable question. So I guess I was replying just being clear before a bunch of people get confused and presume a reward for the testnet : ) @chimp

Isn't Goerli winding down at the end of 2023? Are you sure we are going to participate on Goerli?


[12/17/2023 4:00 PM] jo__hn
Any particular reason why Goerli was chosen? My understanding is the testnet is being sunset. It might be easier to get testnet stETH on Sepolia perhaps.

Agreed. I think it would be good to look at a different testnet for the next phase of testing.
There seems to be a lot of activity on Holesky and it looks like that is where Lido stETH is moving their testing, but I haven't seen the move from Arbitrum yet. Need both Arbitrum and Lido stETH on the same testnet. Perhaps only the final close of Goerli will push the developers to add the new testnets fully.

No problem.  Is there more testing that I can help with on this front?  Was going to let the staked stETH sit for a bit before unlocking, if the MOR accrual is live in the contract.  If not, I can unstake now to check.  Happy to test out anything I'm able to.

right now its just a dashboard to see available pools, deposit and withdraw into those pools, claim your testnet mor, see your testnet more balance

I have a question. Thinking about depositing stETH. Ethereum has so many attacks on smart contracts with flash loans. 

With all these flash loans and aggregating txs on Ethereum, could somebody just be doing it for the exact block and have to pay near 0 in fees or collateral?

{Reactions}
üëçüèº 

[12/22/2023 1:20 AM] smartagents
Great question. I guess as long as the Smart Contract sweeps the yield for the day during those 2 minutes no problem.


[12/22/2023 1:21 AM] smartagents
It would be funny behavior though, people flashing loaning stETH into Morpheus to deposit yield and earn more MOR.


[12/22/2023 1:21 AM] smartagents
But the way it is calculating it right now, it looks like per block.

[12/22/2023 1:21 AM] smartagents
Right. Agreed. Though what's the down side for Morpheus?


[12/22/2023 1:22 AM] jabo38.
if somebody flash loans for each block, they could take the 1/4 of the rewards


[12/22/2023 1:22 AM] smartagents
As long as they are providing 1/4 of the contributions that's ok with me : )
As long as the yield contributed is being rewarded 1 for 1 for everyone fairly.
I expect the cost of the flash loan will be higher than the stETH yield generated during that block.
So it wouldn't be cost effective.


[12/22/2023 1:24 AM] jabo38.
hmmmmmm. I think it is overall a little worse for marketcap. It is basically an MEV game at that point. I'll explain.

Right now as it is, people contribute stETH and hope to get MOR in return. These people will be more likely to join the community and possibly participate in other ways and believe in the project. 

Somebody who figures out mathematically how to extract value and figures, "If I do flash loan for each block to get the max MOR reward" doesn't really care about the project or vision but is just crunching numbers for value extracted. They will also be dumping probably each block into USD which causes sell pressure each block. 

Where as the normal stETH contributor is going to be a holder.


[12/22/2023 1:24 AM] smartagents
I agree long term community people are more desirable. And it should be a fair game. Though I'm still not understanding how "day trader flash loan degen guy" is getting an "advantage" over anyone else. 

He borrows stETH, stakes it for a block, donates the resulting yield to Morpheus like anyone else. Except instead of doing it for 1 stETH he does it for 100 stETH. That would create more yield and thus buy up more of the MOR token supply and add more liquidity to the AMM.

Yes, I and Erik and others have noticed before that there naturally will be an arb between MOR earned via yield or bought on the market. The amount of stETH yield implies a MOR price. If the MOR price for yield is higher people will buy it instead on the AMM or if its lower via yield they should earn more MOR than otherwise.


[12/22/2023 1:28 AM] jabo38.
Lets say right now there is 100 stETH in the contract staking to get MOR. 

Somebody flash loans and borrows 900 stETH, stakes, claims more, gets 90% of the MOR for that block, then withdrawals stETH and pays back flash loan and dumps the MOR. 

The original and long term stakers get a fraction of what they would have gotten compared to the flash loaner.


[12/22/2023 1:28 AM] jabo38.
I don't know enough about flash loans and aggregating txs on ethereum and how the mor contract works to even know if that is an attack vector, but was just brainstorming


[12/22/2023 1:28 AM] smartagents
Yes. I understand that. But in the process the flash loaner has contributed 90% of the stETH yield during that block. That yield then bought MOR out of the AMM and more stETH liquidity got added to the AMM.


[12/22/2023 1:29 AM] smartagents
If they keep flash loaning every block they become a long term MOR contributor : )


[12/22/2023 1:29 AM] smartagents
They just did it with less stETH as principle. I don't know if flash loaning will pay off for them or not, but I still don't see the negative.


[12/22/2023 1:29 AM] jabo38.
hahahaha. got it. I'm still learning how the flash loans work.


[12/22/2023 1:29 AM] smartagents
Great questions though. We all have to think through this game theory.


[12/22/2023 1:29 AM] jabo38.
I think for me it is just that the flash loaners are just chasing yield however they can.


[12/22/2023 1:30 AM] smartagents

If it brings more liquidity and value to the Morpheus community then everyone wins : )

[12/22/2023 1:30 AM] jabo38.
it is true that they are contributing ETH, but the regular loaners will probably contribute more than just ETH


[12/22/2023 1:30 AM] smartagents
Ah yes, but the regular loaners get a different reward for Code, Compute, and Community building that the flash loaner does not.


[12/22/2023 1:31 AM] jabo38.

Yea I don‚Äôt think this matters, people can flash loan steth as much as they want, they will likely even under perform imo due to the interest they will pay, ultimately they are still contributing yield like anyone else and the yield in any one block, even for a large amount of steth, is going to be almost immaterial

(Which is still just fine here)


[12/23/2023 1:49 AM] jonisjon
But I don‚Äôt think anyone is trying to optimize yield for a single block, in reality steth only rebases once a day, so technically there is 0 yield for the majority of individual blocks


[12/23/2023 1:50 AM] jonisjon
(Unless you time it just right which would be very difficult)


[12/23/2023 10:44 AM] kehndry
This would take a HIGHLY disparate implied pricing via AMM and pool ‚Äî thinking off the top of my head here.


[12/23/2023 11:16 AM] smartagents
Yeah. The daily rebase is a good point. One of the testers pointed out that the rewards are currently calculated per block, but rebasing is only once a day. So best to have the Smart Contracts only allow a withdraw of stETH after 24 hours and a little bit extra. That way anyone providing stETH has to keep it in long enough to actually contribute yield to the Protocol Owned Liquidity. Minimum viable stETH lock up period.

Ask @Helios I believe they have some goETH for testers

‚ÄúCapital Contribution

Providing capital is available for public groups.

The user should specify the amount of tokens to provide, but not less than the minimum for the group, and then specify the group ID.‚Äù


[12/24/2023 2:21 AM] shmink.eth
Can someone please explain the meaning of groups, who are they, who can become a group? And any general explanation about it


[12/24/2023 5:04 AM] smartagents
I think the language could be more clear.
The groups are the 4 Cs. Capital, Code, Compute & Community.
The only group that can provide stETH is the Capital group.
Any one can contribute stETH yield.


[12/24/2023 7:38 AM] jumbo3260
Does community mean like community will be able to buy it or something else?

In short its the people who generate the demand for the Compute, Capital and Code.


[12/25/2023 3:56 AM] smartagents
So for example someone set up a Front End website that attracted lots of demand of "language tokens" LTs that are then provided by the Compute Providers. Needs to be more definition here as the protocol has to achieve a way for this to be gamed. Current proposal is around burning of MOR to avoid spamming fake demand as it would have a cost : )

when is the deadline for "Interested" for capital providers


[12/27/2023 11:48 PM] smartagents
Not really a deadline, but after the Smart Contracts go live on Mainnet then everyone who said "interested" should be tagged here to let them know its live. I figure everyone will be aware the Network is live after that so no need to express interest post launch. 

Based on the current testing looks like it could be mid next month, but there are no magic dates, it will take what ever amount of time it takes for developers / testers to find as many bugs or edge cases as possible.

capital just deposits stETH on mainnet or Arb. #üíªÔ∏±compute-providers would beed a machine/node

@Helios  - Question for you:   For people who participate in testnet, will they get MOR when mainnet goes live?


[12/28/2023 8:35 AM] the77helios
Nope. No farming here bud

Node doesn't look like its required for Capital. Only Compute so far.

Anyone can offer coding to Morpheus or find bugs in the Smart Contracts. 
They are in testnet right now. That is one of the way to help add value to the community right now.

Welcome to the community.  
Friendly tip. Try to avoid pooling funds. That tends to create a lot of complexity, debates over ownership. If everyone has their own personal ETH address and can collect their own rewards that is generally a best practice.

The only thing used by the Smart Contact is the "yield" of stETH.

stETH is deposited on Ethereum mainnet and MOR rewards are claimed on Arbitrum. You might want to test the process to get better understanding

[1/15/2024 6:26 PM] antonb
When you try to stake lower amount, does it stake correct?


[1/15/2024 6:35 PM] kblkusamakingdom
Just tried with 0.001 and it staked 0.000666666666666666 stETH. So same ratio, odd


[1/15/2024 7:04 PM] antonb
Yeah, same odd for me


[1/15/2024 7:08 PM] kblkusamakingdom
If you then query the contract for the amount deposited it shows the original amount not the 0.66 amount, confusing

Sorry for the ping ser.

In the recent #üîäÔ∏±announcements in states
> keep in mind the stETH and MOR tokens will not be claimable / sendable until day 91 after phase 1 of the bootstrapping period is complete for Code & Capital Providers.

Does this mean stETH deposited will be locked for 90 days? Or will stETH be withdrawable whenever during the bootstrapping phase?


[1/16/2024 1:31 AM] antonb
This topic has been discussed in telegram, you can join and check
https://t.me/MorpheusAI

TL:DR. Most likely withdraw and claim functions are connected, meaning you can't withdraw without claiming rewards at the same time. As tokens are not claimable during the bootstrapping period you won't be able to withdraw also. But @SmartAgents will additionally check with devs.

Correct, you can claim rewards without withdrawing stETH, but when you withdraw you claim rewards simultaneously.


[1/16/2024 4:07 PM] welcometocolin
Gm @antonb | will not DM you how much are we hoping to raise over the 90day bootstrapping period as POL? Rough calculations: for every $100k ETH locked in the bootstrapping contract, the POL we generate from the yield is circa $1k (probably slightly less). So do we have a target in mind for the bootstrapping phase? We‚Äôd need $30m locked to get $300k POL.

I think the more the liquidity is deep in one place is better then it getting spread out, but the paper and proposals are to make Morpheus multi chain, so that will bring up the question in the future when that happens.


[1/16/2024 5:13 PM] antonb
I don't think it's predictable, I know there are guys with 1000s of ETH, but can't say what amount they are going to invest. Free market will decide.

Your calculations are correct, every $100k of deposited stETH results in roughly ~$1k of protocol own liquidity.


[1/16/2024 5:15 PM] antonb
Can't agree more, I'd rather have solid liquidity on one chain than thin on several.

{Reactions}
sadgepray 

[1/16/2024 5:17 PM] smartagents
The nice thing is the liquidity will continue to grow over time. Not just of MOR but of stETH as both are contributed as part of the yield from Capital Providers.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[1/16/2024 5:31 PM] antonb
Not only liquidity will grow, but MOR price also as it bought from market, it's definitely a win-win case.

Thinking of initial MOR price, will it be set by pairing stETH yield and 51,444 MOR from the protection funds leveraged for purpose of bootstrapping?

For instance, on day 91 we have $50000 of stETH yield, pairing it with 51 444 MOR gives us start price $0.97 / 1 MOR


[1/16/2024 5:33 PM] smartagents
Yes, the best starting point is for Protection Funds to be used to kick off the AMM pool. And yes there should be 4% of MOR emissions available day 90 for that purpose.


[1/16/2024 5:34 PM] smartagents
Right. The unknown variable is how much stETH the Capital Providers will add to the Smart Contracts.


[1/16/2024 5:36 PM] antonb

üëçüèº 

[1/16/2024 5:36 PM] smartagents
The free market will figure it out : ) Some equalibrum will form over time based on the implied price of earning MOR from stETH yield and being able to buy it from the AMM pool.

Rewards are calculated every second, so if you decide to withdraw stETH, the accrual of rewards will stop, but MOR that has already been earned will remain with and you will be able to withdraw it after bootstrapping period.

Hi, do I understand this right: after launch, I can provide liquidity in stETH. Its been a long time since I had anything to do with LPs. I assume, this is only one way liquidity provision and it is not affected by impermanent loss?


[1/21/2024 11:29 PM] antonb
Hi. That's correct, but I can't describe process as liquidity provision, rather capital provision or depositing.


[1/21/2024 11:30 PM] antonb
You provide your capital to contract which use generated yield to create protocol owned liquidity


[1/21/2024 11:43 PM] basado8068
Thank you. So it is possible to deploy a strategy: for 90 days providing stETH, after 90 days claiming rewards and withdrawing stETH (then buy with stETH on AMM for whichever the price will be)


[1/22/2024 12:19 AM] antonb
You actually can withdraw deposited stETH any moment, it's not locked.


[1/22/2024 12:23 AM] antonb
Your strategy should work. Seems like someone is going to pack big bags of MOR, right?

Agreed. This is at the heart of the Techno Capital Machine (TCM) model that Morpheus is pioneering and everyone building on top of Morpheus can leverage.

I don‚Äôt entirely understand how MOR will be distributed during the 90 day bootstrapping event. Will I get MOR equivalent to the yield on stETH or as a portion of all stETH provided during the bootstrapping?


[1/22/2024 6:29 PM] kwisatz__
For the former, if I stake 10 stETH with a hypothetical 90 day yield of 2%, I‚Äôll receive MOR equivalent to .2 ETH? 

For the latter, if I stake 10 stETH in a pool totaling 100 stETH, I‚Äôll receive 10% of all MOR distributed during the bootstrapping event?

Or other scenarios?


[1/22/2024 6:52 PM] maharajaxbt
if i undestood corectly, you are getting mor only on the yield your steth deposited made, and it will be proportionally to the size of the pool, i think rewards are calculated like every 12sec. So lets say you got 0.1steth yield, and the total pool is 1steth of yield, you will get 10% of the mor distributed because your yield was 10% of the total pool yield generated


[1/22/2024 6:53 PM] maharajaxbt
also you get your steth deposit back at the end (or whenever you decide to withdraw) but the yield stays with the project and generates liquidity pool for after the 90th day when trading goes live


[1/22/2024 7:08 PM] kwisatz__
Ok, that‚Äôs fair. That would still make the distribution proportionate to the pool size. Kind of what I was looking for considering the opportunity cost of locking up capital for 90 days.


[1/22/2024 7:10 PM] kwisatz__
Can anyone verify this?


[1/22/2024 7:56 PM] antonb
@Maharaja explanation is generally correct, you receive part of MOR distribution dedicated for capital providers based on your share in deposited stETH pool.


[1/22/2024 7:57 PM] antonb
Your stETH isn't locked, you can withdraw any moment (*but not earlier than 24 hours from deposit due to Lido daily staking rewards distribution)

[1/25/2024 12:49 AM] theportal_
Hmmm, i'm diving into the docs to get familiar with everything. Only question is, if I can provide stETH and withdraw it 24 hours later, theoretically I can deposit 90 x the amount of capital over the 90 day bootstrapping period. If everyone deposits and withdraws, how exactly is the protocol being bootstrapped?


[1/25/2024 12:55 AM] theportal_
Ok... so essentially it doesn't matter how many times I deposit or withdraw, because the value being injected into the liquidity pool is only accrued through yield?


[1/25/2024 12:57 AM] smartagents
Yep. 24 hours is beyond the daily rebasing period. So the yield gets contributed. You can take the stETH out after that if you want.


[1/25/2024 12:57 AM] theportal_
And therefore, it's actually -EV for me to deposit and withdraw multiple times because I'm not actually compounding?... If i understand correctly


[1/25/2024 12:58 AM] smartagents
EV? Compounding? Can you expand on that?


[1/25/2024 1:00 AM] theportal_
"Expected Value". Essentially I was wondering if, let's say I deposited 1 stETH for 89 consecutive days and withdraw 89 times. My share of the rewards for MOR won't be equivalent to 89 stETH, but rather the yield from 1 stETH that i keep repeatedly depositing and withdrawing


[1/25/2024 1:01 AM] theportal_
I haven't dived enough into the paper to understand the mechanics, i was just wondering if theoretically it was possible to maximize the exepected value and whether that could actually harm the bootstrapping process..


[1/25/2024 1:02 AM] astha22
I want to provide capital


[1/25/2024 1:05 AM] theportal_
What i'm wondering, really, is how I can compete with larger depositors who can provide 1000 stETH if I can only provide 1 -- which is what led me to think that maybe if I can withdraw the stETH after 24 hours. I can then deposit it back and start compounding my potential returns. But, from what I understand, the rewards are generated from the yield, so I would actually be losing yield by trying to gamify the deposit and withdrawal process because the rewards would be paused once I withdraw. I hope I'm making sense.


[1/25/2024 1:06 AM] theportal_
Essentially to earn more rewards I can't deposit the same stETH over and over again. I actually have to inject new capital. Correct?


[1/25/2024 1:19 AM] muskey_
@purple, def read through the whitepaper and the bootstrapping period section. Withdrawing and depositing would not benefit you. It's pro-rata, my understanding is there is no way for someone with 1 eth to compete with someone that has deposited 1000. The 1000 eth depositor would end up with 1000x MOR of the 1 eth depositor if my understanding is correct.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[1/25/2024 1:21 AM] muskey_
The yield is given to the protocol, and the protocol gets deeper liquidity over time, it's paying those yield providers pro-rata in MOR to incentivize those "donations" of yield.


[1/25/2024 1:31 AM] antonb
Longer you deposit, more rewards you get. I can't foresee scenarious when frequent deposit/withdraw can game the system.

There is no valuation. Check out the white paper section on Capital Providers.
Its an open competition for the MOR emissions each day. 3,456 MOR per day to start and the decay rate reduces it each day after.

You can provide capital to the contract when they are live on the 8th of Feb whether it be syndicated or not


[1/29/2024 6:12 PM] davetherave3385
What happens with the testnet MOR we have accumulated does that get swapped to mainnet MOR eventualy


[1/29/2024 6:16 PM] antonb
They are just dummy coins to help users get a sense of the process and test contract.


[1/29/2024 6:17 PM] davetherave3385
hmmm so will these users get any kind of rewards


[1/29/2024 6:18 PM] antonb
No. The only way to get MOR rewards starting from Feb 8th is through contributing capital or code

i have no clue on these things lol. i thought test net users would get something which was obviously wrong. Thought test net on others got some airdrop stuff. Another lesson leared will have to stick some cash money into the thing come 8th Feb (happily)

I see where you come from. That's the current market trend, to reward users for their participation in testnet. 

Morpheus is something different you rarely can see in crypto. Protocol builds open source by the community.  There are no founders, no team, no investors, but fair launch with equal conditions for everyone.

Just to confirm, we will be depositing stETH on Ethereum, earning $MOR on Arbitrum.

Liquidity will be on ETH or Arbitrum, or both? Will there be a bridge to bridge MOR on Arb to ETH?


[1/30/2024 4:32 AM] darthtrader_0x
Can we earn on arb at all why depositing any assets or only stETH on ethereum?


[1/30/2024 4:49 AM] antonb
The plan is to have it on ARB


[1/30/2024 4:49 AM] samina5186
so i tried the claim and withdraw and then again staked and have not claimed - so am i good ?


[1/30/2024 4:49 AM] samina5186
should i claim now ??


[1/30/2024 4:49 AM] antonb
But everyone can set a pool on ETH as well


[1/30/2024 4:50 AM] thade
Ok so main liquidity will be on Arb, but there will be a token on ETH as well


[1/30/2024 4:51 AM] antonb
It's up to you, mate. Good news is that you won't need to interact with the contract directly (unless you really want it) as here is the website (for test purpose) you can connect your wallet and deposit in a few clicks.

Can't confirm it 100%, so let's better ask @SmartAgents


[1/30/2024 4:55 AM] samina5186
this one on Eth or on Sepolia Testnet ?


[1/30/2024 4:57 AM] antonb
Eth sepolia testnet


[1/30/2024 4:58 AM] samina5186
ok doing this now again - as of now it says your portion 0%


[1/30/2024 5:00 AM] antonb
Keep in mind it's very first iteration for testing and you are among firsts! So it's ok if you meet some bugs


[1/30/2024 5:00 AM] samina5186
absolutely


[1/30/2024 5:00 AM] antonb
You can report them in #‚ö°Ô∏±code-providers


[1/30/2024 5:01 AM] samina5186
so i am on the first Private group - where on the top it is showing me 44 MOR but


[1/30/2024 5:02 AM] samina5186
i am not able to share a screen shot


[1/30/2024 5:02 AM] thade
Yeah the depositing stETH on main net, but getting MOR on Arb is confusing and kinda makes things over complicated.


[1/30/2024 5:03 AM] antonb
Could I know why do you think so?


[1/30/2024 5:04 AM] antonb
Meaning what exactly confuses you


[1/30/2024 5:10 AM] thade
I personally don't care where the token/liquidity is, just seems overcomplicated with the amount of dev work needed to take stETH deposits on one chain, then rewards on another chain, but have liquidity on both chains which would then require a bridge and more contracts to be built.


[1/30/2024 5:12 AM] smartagents
Goal is to making MOR cheap to send for the utility of using it to pay for Inference of AI models.

Cool, understand that, but why not just use wstETH on Arb and cut out Ethereum all together?


[1/30/2024 5:16 AM] smartagents
Nice to have the start on Ethereum if the records need to ever more to another Layer 2.


[1/30/2024 5:19 AM] samina5186
Ok so last time when i got the stEth they were not showing on the website, so did the process again and now it is showing - Depost stEth done


[1/30/2024 5:21 AM] samina5186
so now will leave the depost as of now - but yes I can see the claim MOR now

There is no such requirement for capital provision


[1/30/2024 5:43 AM] erictfo
on the test website it says group 1 is private, how do i become a capital provider?


[1/30/2024 5:44 AM] smartagents
Its just private for testing purposes.


[1/30/2024 5:44 AM] erictfo
or will it become public on 8th feb to deposit ?


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] smartagents
Yes it will be public on February 8th.


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] erictfo
also will we be depositing sETH on eth or on arb..?


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] smartagents
stETH on Ethereum I believe.


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] erictfo
okay thanks!


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] erictfo
can code providers run their nodes rn to earn rewards alrdy? @SmartAgents


[1/30/2024 5:45 AM] erictfo
or does rewards start at 8th too for nodes


[1/30/2024 5:47 AM] smartagents
There is no reward for nodes. A full node will be useful in running Morpheus Compute, Code, Capital and Community functions but is not required.


[1/30/2024 6:01 AM] onchainponzi
Will we have a clean stETH staking portal instead of GitHub repo?


[1/30/2024 6:46 AM] lemonflex
@SmartAgents will initial liquidity be provided by the team or by capital/code providers as they earn MOR rewards in Phase 1?


[1/30/2024 6:47 AM] lemonflex
why not Arbitrum? it's significantly cheaper


[1/30/2024 6:48 AM] lemonflex
ok just read this

[1/30/2024 12:56 PM] antonb
The initial liquidity will be bootstrapped by pairing 90 days of Protection Fund emissions (51 444 MOR) and yield earned from provided capital.


[1/30/2024 2:23 PM] onchainponzi
Can you withdraw your stETH anytime?

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[1/30/2024 2:59 PM] antonb
Yes, but only after 24 hours from deposit due to Lido's rebase period.


[1/30/2024 3:27 PM] lemonflex
so the initial liquidity will be stETH/MOR? or will you just converted the yield to ETH and add as ETH/MOR?


[1/30/2024 3:28 PM] lemonflex
is it also possible to know more about how the stETH will be managed? is it kept in a multi-sig during the first 90 days @antonb | will not DM you ?


[1/30/2024 4:52 PM] antonb
That's the plan, afaik, but there is enough time for the final decision. In case of Arb it would be wstETH/MOR.


[1/30/2024 4:56 PM] antonb
Good question I don't know the right answer for. But it feels sensible to have multisig.


[1/30/2024 6:00 PM] lemonflex
This would be important to clarify before launch since that contract will hold a lot of money, do you have any auditors on it? Launch is supposed to be in 9 days...


[1/30/2024 6:32 PM] antonb
Yeah, it passed internal audit, cybersec audit and bug bounty testing starts today

My concern is mainly related to the owner address of the Distribution.sol contract. In other similar protocols, the owner is either a TimeLock contract owned by a multi-sig or just a multi-sig. A TimeLock is better since users get alerted on pending actions.

Smart Contracts always have risks of bugs. 
You can see the audit and test reports on Github. Lot of community testing.
That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

Yes, you can. On Feb 8th, you will need to deposit min 0.01 stETH into the Contract, that makes you eligible for MOR token rewards.

I'd really recommend to read #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs  as it especially crafted to address most of Morpheus aspects and help you get proper understanding before deep dive.

[1/31/2024 9:16 PM] antonb
It's about the novel way for launching projects, called Techno Capital Machine (TCM) that is pioneered by Morpheus

**Tl;dr**
- Developer launches an open source project using the Techno Capital Machine.
- Using TCM, the developer deploys a native token to power their project.
- Users staking stETH can choose to allocate their yield to projects.
- In exchange for allocating their yield to help fund a project, users are rewarded with a proportional stream of the project‚Äôs native token.
- 50% of the yield allocated to a project is used to purchase that project‚Äôs native token.
- The native tokens are then paired with the other 50% of the yield and deposited to a liquidity pool on an AMM.

[1/31/2024 11:40 PM] muskey_
Hi all, so after the 90 day bootstrapping period the Capital Contributor contract will purchase MOR with half the yield it has earned. I assume that will be front ran everyday? Or will the cadence be random of the purchases, and is it daily?


[2/1/2024 12:13 AM] antonb
I believe that the time for buy will be arbitrary every time


[2/1/2024 12:17 AM] muskey_
I understand it's late in the game but it could be worth developing a situation where the purchases are not through the uniswap pool. As that value will likely be extracted by MEV bots, arbitrary buy times or not, everyday. If I understand correctly.


[2/1/2024 12:22 AM] antonb
I'm not deeply familiar with MEV bots mechanics. Can you please explain how it could work in Morpheus' case?


[2/1/2024 12:24 AM] antonb
What if the swap amounts are split up to a certain limit that is not profitable for bots?


[2/1/2024 12:25 AM] muskey_
Sure, in basic terms. It's public knowledge there is a guarenteed buyer in the market. You can publicly view how much the entity will buy (the cumulative stETH yield). Someone could create a bot to sandwich attack that buyer every time, it would buy the exact amount of MOR required for max profit right before the purchase, and then sell it into the pool directly after. Extracting all of the newly provided stETH yield basically.


[2/1/2024 12:25 AM] muskey_
I believe it would have to be insanely low to the point the gas costs wouldn't make sense for the bot. But then you're probably burning all the stETH yeild on gas for each of those transactions, kind of burning the value into gas fees rather than giving it to the bot.


[2/1/2024 12:28 AM] muskey_
Off the top of my head, a clean solution would be to allocate MOR from the protocol to pair with the stETH yield, then provide liquidity to the pool. So there is no actual purchase from the pool that could be frontran. But then you would have to re-design the contracts / rewards. The MOR would probably come from the 24% allocated to Capitle Providers bucket.


[2/1/2024 12:29 AM] antonb
Thanks. You suggested purchases through other DEXes, right? How might this change things?


[2/1/2024 12:29 AM] antonb
@SmartAgents @The Oracle


[2/1/2024 12:31 AM] muskey_
No, as my point just above. I would probably suggest pulling from the 24% allocated to the Capital Provdiers bucket. It would give the providers less MOR, but the protocol would get more liquidity without value being extracted, benefiting all participants and not rewarding malicious extractors. It would also be a fairly minimal amount of MOR from the Capital Providers bucket each day to pair with the stETH yield earned and provided as liquidity.


[2/1/2024 12:34 AM] antonb
Did I understand correctly that bots are developed to attack a specific account?


[2/1/2024 12:36 AM] muskey_
No, MEV bots extract value in various ways on-chain. One of them is sandwich attack, where they see a large buy coming into a uniswap pool, front run it by buying the token before the big purchase, then sell into the pool after the big purchase. Known as a sandwich attack:

[2/1/2024 12:36 AM] antonb
I mean that based on your message above, every swap on DEX should be attacked if it is profitable?


[2/1/2024 12:37 AM] muskey_
Yes, it's very common


[2/1/2024 12:38 AM] muskey_
And that's when the amount and buyer are unknown with little time to react. In the Morpheus case, the buyer is guranteed and the amount is known, it's free money for someone in a sense.


[2/1/2024 12:38 AM] whizke
Just to clarify, there's no maximum amount someone can provide for capital, correct?


[2/1/2024 12:40 AM] antonb
Right, only minimum


[2/1/2024 12:41 AM] muskey_
The amount of yield each day will probably not be enormous in Morpheus. But, in the current state it's potentially giving that yield away to value extractors that don't contribute to the system. IF the yield was paired with fresh MOR, that would avoid the extractable value. In my opinion while only thinking about all of this during our chat


[2/1/2024 12:41 AM] antonb
Need to talk to friends running MEV business


[2/1/2024 12:42 AM] antonb
Yeah, smthng like Liquidity Fund


[2/1/2024 12:43 AM] muskey_
Yea, I think I have the rough idea of the solution in my mind but would need to mull it over


[2/1/2024 12:46 AM] antonb
First that come in mind is possible situation where yield exceeds potential MOR emissions for liquidity.

Extremely appreciate you raised this point.

Let's wait when someone from the contract contributors take a look. Maybe they have a solution already.


[2/1/2024 12:47 AM] muskey_
Yea that's my thought too, fully determined by the price of MOR at the moment. High variance likely


[2/1/2024 12:47 AM] muskey_
Or you just accept that value is potentially being extracted, a side effect is the MOR price is lower, and buyers get a better price if they want to take a position in MOR.

CowSwap is great, and works well. But my understanding is if you know the upcoming guaranteed buyers address, you could monitor that, and CowSwap potentially wouldn‚Äôt help in this scenario. But definitely worth exploring, good call.


[2/1/2024 3:31 AM] mahalleinirx
In the case of Morpheus no one is buying the stETH yield, it all gets pooled into an AMM to bootstrap liquidity and the token emissions are through a rebase mechanism pro-rata to Capital Providers. While there is a question about how long someone will need to have their stETH staked and if a random rebasing is the best course here so people can't stake right before rebase and then pull out, I'm not sure there is risk of a sandwich attack here


[2/1/2024 3:36 AM] antonb
I think he is talking about MEV bot attack in the moment when the contract buys MOR from AMM to pair it with another 50% of stETH yield


[2/1/2024 3:43 AM] mahalleinirx
Hmm not sure if there is a mechanism for the contract to buy MOR, maybe after the bootstrapping as the protection fund is used for the other side


[2/1/2024 4:07 AM] muskey_
Yea, I'm talking about after the bootstrapping period. Where have the yield is sold to buy MOR


[2/1/2024 4:08 AM] smartagents
Good call to address the MEV and Sandwich attack vector.
Will be something to address before day 90 when the AMM starts.

Has it been confirmed if this will be live on Feb 8th? Wondering if there will be some basic steps provided on how to provide capital. Anyone please correct me if I'm wrong but it  sounds like we swap ETH to stETH on Lido, then deposit stETH into the contract on ETH network to stake, then after 90 days everything will unlock and we'll be able to withdraw MOR from ARB or unstake our stETH. Is that right? Lmfao crypto is so complicated but I love it

Can I check will u still continue to earn $MOR even after u withdraw ur stETH?

this is in reference to this:
"Do I lose $MOR earned/Rewards if I decide to withdraw $stETH?
No if you withdraw you will continue earning MOR based on the amount of stETH you deposited weighted by how long it was deposited."


[2/1/2024 2:32 PM] zj.valz
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if u withdraw ur stETH, u won't earn anymore $MOR, but the $MOR earned till the date of withdrawal will still be there and claimable after 91 days right?


[2/1/2024 2:33 PM] zj.valz
because the explaination here seems to suggest that $MOR will continuously be earned even if u withdraw ur stETH, which does not really make sense

You won't lose what you've already earned, but new rewards won't accrue as you withdrew stETH and therefore not the Capital Contributor.

Sorry if this is a dumb question but I am trying to use the UI interface, I have a Metamask wallet and am on the Sepolia Testnet and have roughly 1 Sepolia ETH in my wallet but the stETH in the dropdown menu shows zero and there is no functionality to stake or really press any buttons anywhere except to connect my wallet...what am I doing wrong?

Okay thanks. So basically it is just a frontend at the moment and not really working at all? No criticism but I would have thought testing involved actually being able to test depositing Sepolia stETH via the interface. Will the interface be usable once depositing goes live on the the 8th?


[2/1/2024 11:06 PM] antonb
It's been usable yesterday, likely some changes are ongoing rn and obviously everything will work smoothly on Feb 8th.

That would be great, thanks! I was trying it out yesterday and it did not work either. Perhaps the problem is on my end. Sepolia Testnet selected in Metamask and the "mined" sepolia ETH should be enough or anything else I should be doing (for the interface)?

After reading up on it, I want to make sure I've got it right, if someone can confirm. Starting from February 8th (date subject to change), I can deposit ETH on Lido and then depositing stETH into the $Mor contract. After 90 days, I will receive $Mor rewards.

@antonb | will not DM you  sorry a little confused on, will we have to bridge the ETH (MAINNET) to buy MOR on Feb 8th ?


[2/3/2024 3:04 AM] samina5186
also will there be a cap on how much we need to provide or it is up to us ?


[2/3/2024 3:33 AM] mahalleinirx
There is no cap and you will need stETH to be able to stake


[2/3/2024 4:30 AM] antonb
You can't buy MOR on Feb 8th, but deposit your stETH on Ethereum mainnet to be rewarded with MOR tokens pro rata to your contribution. These tokens will only be claimable/sendable after 90 days.


[2/3/2024 5:00 AM] antonb
@lengx Hey friend


[2/3/2024 5:03 AM] antonb
The process is quite simple. Tententively on the 8th of Feb contract go live. You'll need stETH for deposit which you can withdraw any moment after 24hours.
For your contribution you will be rewarded with MOR tokens proportionally to your contribution. Tokens you rewarded with are claimable ~ May 9th.

Here is the test website https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/ that would help you get a sense of the process.

so the deposit is only for 24 hours right  and get your allocation - correct ??

and claim on 9th May


[2/3/2024 5:23 AM] antonb
Feb 8th is the date of smart contract deploy on the Ethereum mainnet, while it live, you are free to deposit for any period you consider comfortable for you. You also can withdraw any time after 24hours after deposit.

so accumulation of stEth Yeild will depend on the time it is staked in the contract ??


[2/3/2024 5:26 AM] samina5186
so say my MOR allocation will depend on if if stake for 24 hours or 36 or 5 days ?


[2/3/2024 5:27 AM] samina5186
yes gotcha that is has to be least for 24 hours


[2/3/2024 5:33 AM] antonb
Let's me put it this way:
Your stETH is in contract => you earn MOR rewards
No stETH in contract (you withdrew it) => no MOR rewards

Amount of the rewards mostly depends on two components:
- Time. The longer period of deposit, the more rewards
- Amount. The bigger figure means larger share in the total pool and therefore more rewards.
I believe you will be able see them near real-time in your dashboard on the website.

If I understood this correctly staking stETH for 3 months will give you the most rewards as oppose to just staking and removing


[2/3/2024 11:00 AM] thade
Yes. The longer you stake the more rewards you‚Äôll be able to claim. You‚Äôre rewarded for the amount of yield youre contributing. Morpheus takes your yield but rewards you with $MOR.

oh I see okay, does the rewards scale with how much stETH we provide? If so may I know what is the recommended amount of stETH for the best yield?


[2/3/2024 6:57 PM] antonb
The amount of the rewards effectively depends on two components:
- Time. The longer the deposit period, the more rewards. 
- Amount. The bigger figure means a larger share in the total pool and therefore more rewards.


[2/3/2024 9:31 PM] mangdebas
thanks antonb!

I read the FAQ and I have some questions about the bootstrap.

1. When they say we can withdraw the staked stETH after 48 hours, does that mean we should? Or its better to stake and hold it in there for 90 days?

2. Also the reward is based on 1. amount of stETH, 2. time of staked stETH (meaning the longer you stake the more rewards?)

3. during the 90 days, we can add more stETH right? It wont be locked up and unavailable after 8th feb.

4. Will there be a max cap of amount of stETH the contract can take?


[2/3/2024 9:35 PM] gilougt
Hi everyone 
What time will the deposits be open on February 8?


[2/3/2024 9:44 PM] antonb
Hi. There will be an announcement. Keep an eye at #üîäÔ∏±announcements


[2/3/2024 9:54 PM] antonb
Good questions.

1) Lockup period is solely connected to Lido's rebase period. Protocol just has to be sure that deposited stETH has enough time to generate yield. 
You can stake and hold for days, weeks, months or even years. While your stETH in the contract and generate yield for Morpheus to create Protocol owned Liquidity, you receive rewards.

2) Can't really say what is better for you as it depends on the strategy you will pick.

3) Correct, you can either add or remove not only these 90 days, but 256 years of MOR emissions

4) No max cap


[2/3/2024 9:57 PM] mangdebas
About selecting the strategy I need to understand the differences.

For this statement " Protocol just has to be sure that deposited stETH has enough time to generate yield." Does that mean for example,

i stake 1 ETH and withdraw it after 24 hours 
VS
i stake 1 ETH and leave it in there for 90 days

is the result the same for both?


[2/3/2024 10:08 PM] antonb
In the first case you will get rewards generated for 1 day
In the first case you will get rewards generated for 90 days

TLDR:
Coders choose what to code.
Users choose to what code to run.
Compute Providers choose what models to offer Inference for.
Capital Providers choose what open source to send yield to.
There is no tragedy of the commons, if there are no commons : )
Property rights + open source for the win.


[2/4/2024 10:09 AM] kei0513
Is there any limitation to deposit stETH when the mainnet is live? Like whitelisted memnber or cap. Or any one can  deposit any amount(Ôºû0.01 stETH) to be a capital provider.


[2/4/2024 10:16 AM] kei0513
In the testnet guide, "How to deposit into a group", what's the meaning by the "group"?

Groups are Capital, Code, Compute and Community.
Only one related to providing stETH is the Capital Group.
There is no limit.

I'd credit a lot of people with building up the Morpheus Network. First the coders building the Smart Contracts, the devs creating Node software, the devs working on Smart Agents, the devs working on the Decentralized Compute Router, the Smart Contract testers here on Discord, the Testnet Guide creators, guys like Oracle, Anton and a dozen others spreading memes and talking about Integrations with other OSS projects, the sponsors of the Smart Contract audits, folks like NOUS fine tuning LLMs, folks like Erik Voorhees building Front Ends such as Mor.org. Of course the 42+ anons that wrote papers, contributed code, or added to the community in countless ways since September 2nd 2023.

Soon Morpheus will have every stETH yield Contributor to thank and then Compute Providers offering Inference and finally everyone who deploys a Smart Agent on the network. I'm glad to have done some Podcasts + add to the Github and I'm certainly passionate about Morpheus for sure. But I think a truly decentralized open source community can be orders of magnitude larger than any "team" or "company" ever can be.

For capital providers to choose what open source to send the yield to, I assume this would require forking Morpheus and setting up a different liquidity pool with a different token to MOR?


[2/4/2024 7:09 PM] tinkwangaaa_56587
Hi guys, I‚Äôve read the faq, just wanted to ask if the bootstrapping rewards is distributed based on your weighted proportion of stETH within a given day?

Or is it an average of your proportion of stETH across the whole 90 days, regardless of if you don‚Äôt stay the full duration?

And also enable other assets than ETH that are stakable with yield. That part seems like a no brainer to me.


[2/5/2024 2:29 AM] smartagents
Agreed. Already devs talking about how to make Morpheus multi chain / multi yield.


[2/5/2024 2:30 AM] smartagents
The tech is getting there.


[2/5/2024 2:30 AM] joe_ai
That said, even if somebody creates a new frontend, they can‚Äôt redirect the emission flow of MOR. So it would require a fork afaik.


[2/5/2024 7:21 AM] tinkwangaaa_56587
Perfect, thank you


[2/5/2024 10:33 AM] smartagents
Depends. There a lot of levels of "add MOR to another chain". 
Level 1: Simply adding MOR for payments could be done via a bridge or wrapping MOR onto another chain. This could be done by without much coordination.
Level 2: Yield coming from an asset other than stETH. Say from Thorchain assets or Solana. This could be implemented a few ways either with yield flowing back to Ethereum or funding an AMM on the other chain. This would require more coordination. 
Level 3: A native implementation where a the token emissions of MOR take place on multiple chains. This would require a great deal of work and coordination.

What is the logic behind not having to lock steth in boot strapping period?


[2/5/2024 10:35 AM] kehndry
The solution to this is the one that least fragments liquidity, in my opinion.


[2/5/2024 10:36 AM] smartagents
Agreed. Liquidity is important having 1 AMM is really helpful. Though over time if their is enough demand it could ADD liquidity to have multiple yield sources. Again all depends on the design of the system.

Agreed on the latter.


[2/5/2024 10:40 AM] smartagents

One of the stated goals from the beginning is to have a least friction system.


[2/5/2024 10:41 AM] smartagents
The point of the Bootstrap is to avoid a launch with only of a few tokens in existence. Not to force people to provide yield for a certain amount of time.


[2/5/2024 10:42 AM] kehndry
Yea. Personally, I would be okay with longer lock. The users providing capital should have their interests aligned with the project.


[2/5/2024 10:42 AM] kehndry
Fair enough, but of the same token, you don't want people just moving steth they would've otherwise held in a wallet and getting MOR on top just for depositing.


[2/5/2024 10:45 AM] kehndry
For the bootstrap period, specifically.


[2/5/2024 10:47 AM] smartagents
I hear you. Lot of discussion back and forth on that. But some interesting studies show the opposite of what you would think. The least friction system gains the most participation for the longest period because high friction systems scare away more people from participating at all than they add via their friction.


[2/5/2024 10:47 AM] kehndry

[2/5/2024 10:48 AM] smartagents
Most famously in the early days of Paypal. They made it so you could instantly remove funds, and because of that people treated it like a bank account and just left money in for years, because they could always get it if they needed it.


[2/5/2024 10:48 AM] kehndry
Bootstrapping period is more of a caveat given its only a small period.

That's pretty interesting.


[2/5/2024 10:52 AM] smartagents
For example, I saw a comment in the Discord earlier today. One of the most common questions is: Are the stETH locked for the whole 90 days? And when the answer comes back that there was no lock (after a the yield is contributed) they are happy and amazed and refer to it as "permissionless staking".


[2/5/2024 10:55 AM] smartagents
Sort of a "might as well". 
"Doesn't cost me anything but a little yield". 
"Its just the yield and you can withdraw anytime."


[2/5/2024 10:57 AM] kehndry
Yea I see both sides here. I'm asking myself what's the intent of the individual but maybe I'm looking at it through the wrong lens. My logic is rooted in exactly your quotes, get some yield they wouldn't otherwise get by holding tokens in wallet and just dump when you're ready to move on.


[2/5/2024 11:00 AM] kehndry
Albeit, post boot strapping the counter argument is capital provision is working as intended with the protocol benefitting from the capital and user getting tokens.


[2/5/2024 11:04 AM] smartagents
I hear you. Though what ever yield contributed during the boot strapping period will go toward the same purpose as after the boot strapping period. Buying MOR and adding stETH liquidity. Just all on day 91.


[2/5/2024 11:06 AM] kehndry
Fair enough; that is the point of the bootstrapping period after all ; attract capital and build up $ for LP.

Hi. Take a look at #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs


[2/5/2024 4:49 PM] antonb
@SodaPower It's solely your decision how much capital to dedicate, but that's correct logic the more you deposit, the more rewards you get.


[2/5/2024 5:16 PM] sodapower
Yes. This i understand. 

Is there a way to estimate how many $MOR I can potentially earn in a month if I can contribute 5k dollars? 

I'm finding tough to brain the maths?

I have an item about MOR math in my to-do list. What other metrics would you be interested in?


[2/5/2024 5:20 PM] sodapower
In your opinion, do you think 5k is worthwhile or I should just buy in the open market in the future?.

Seems like it makes much more sense to stake at least 10k dollars of stETH or much more.

5k might be too small of an amount.

This is what I'm struggling to decide now.


[2/5/2024 5:20 PM] antonb
Too small for what?


[2/5/2024 5:21 PM] sodapower
Too small to earn a reasonable amount of MOR on a month to month basis

After the bootstrapping period you will be able to claim your rewards any moment.

The longer you hold stETH in the contract, the more MOR you get.
Bigger share in the pool also equals more MOR rewards.

[2/5/2024 5:45 PM] sodapower
I just read to the faq, just wanted to clarify


[2/5/2024 5:45 PM] antonb
You can only remove after 7 days (recent changes) and you won't earn any rewards if you withdraw the whole stETH amount. Morpheus rewards only those who contribute to liquidity creation. No deposited stETH => no contribution in liquidity => no rewards.

Good day antonb, may I check, am I wrong on anything about the bootstrap? If not I hope this can help othersüòÇ 


Feb 8 Bootstrap day, as of now the timing of launch hasn't been decided

What you need: 
1. web wallet (e.g. metamask)
2. stETH (This token of ETH is meant to be staked)

What is this bootstraping thingy?
You can lock up your stETH and earn interest in $MOR. You are basically providing capital to support the project and getting rewarded in $MOR. 
If you want to you can withdraw your ETH after 7 days.
This staking is like any other staking, the longer you stake your stETH the more rewards you get.
After 90 days $MOR will be tradable. You can still keep your stETH staked to gain interest even after 90 days.
Minimum stake is 0.01 stETH.

What to do on Feb 8:
1. Get stETH on your wallet in the Ethereum network
2. Go to $MOR smart contract website, for me I would check discord and verify its from a trusted member
3. Stake the stETH, is that all?


[2/5/2024 6:14 PM] antonb
Nice and precise recap üëç 
I'd add that MOR rewards user earns depeNd on his share in the total staked stETH pool.


[2/5/2024 6:21 PM] antonb
Also I feel that need to explain the Bootstrapping period purpose.

Essentially it's one time 90 day delay between the moment when the mainnet begins calculating rewards and when those MOR tokens are claimable / sendable by users. The delay will ensure enough MOR tokens are ready for circulation to fulfill the utility functions of the network, thus avoid extreme token scarcity and extreme market volatility.

Also we need the Bootstrapping period to accumulate enough stETH yield for setting up AMM liquidity pool on Day 91. To boot strap the AMM, the 4% of MOR tokens dedicated to the protection funds (51,444 MOR by day 90) will be used for this purpose.


[2/5/2024 7:00 PM] mangdebas
Ahh I see okay, thanks for explaining!

After this 90 days what is the frequency that MOR will be rewarded?

When accumulating enough stETH for setting up the AMM liquidity pool, is the APY for that depending on Lido's yield APY? Currently 3.3% https://stake.lido.fi/


[2/5/2024 7:14 PM] antonb
MOR rewards are calculated every block, what will only change after 90 days is that you could claim MOR any moment.

As in, where does $MOR get its inherent value from?


[2/5/2024 7:22 PM] antonb
Let's say, we have 10 000 ETH in the pool as average for 90days.
If Lido APY is 3,3% then we would end up with ~81 ETH as yield or ~ $190k

Curious for myself


[2/5/2024 10:09 PM] zj.valz
is half of the 81 ETH i.e. 40.5ETH swapped into $MOR and distributed to depositers pro-rata their yield contribution?


[2/5/2024 10:10 PM] zj.valz
other half i assume is going to the $MOR/ETH LP


[2/5/2024 10:26 PM] basado8068
I want to be able to move my stETH anytime. However, I think I would still provide capital even if it meant to lock it. I would be worried to have it locked with withdrawal period more than to have it locked for amount of time specified beforehand. The only risk that I am finding significant is smart contract exploit risk, so far have not seen that there would be a bug found that would affect locked capital tho (the bugs are more about MOR rewards).


[2/5/2024 10:29 PM] antonb
No, whole amount of 81eth from the example, would be paired with  51,444 MOR from 4% of daily protection fund emissions.


[2/5/2024 10:30 PM] kehndry
Good color on your rationale. Thanks


[2/5/2024 10:55 PM] zj.valz
oh wait so to clarify during bootstrapping phase, we are basically competing to earn $MOR (more stETH deposited, more $MOR).
is it possible to elaborate on how the pro-rata is calculated, confused by step 2 in the yellow paper.

My understanding is, %ETH yield provided by the solo depositor is weighted against the total pool.
e.g. Total stETH Pool = 10,000e
Total stETH Pool daily yield = 0.92e  (based on LIDO 3.3% APR)
Solo deposit 10 ETH = daily ETH yield of 0.000925e 

Solo ETH yield vs Total Pool yield = 0.000925e/ 0.92e = 0.10% (This is the part that is confusing me)
$MOR earned = 0.10% * 3456  = 3.46 $MOR

Is this calculation correct?


[2/5/2024 10:57 PM] itzhendrx
does anyone know which is the most profficient way to get steth, is it worth swaping on a dex or minting it through lido?


[2/5/2024 11:03 PM] basado8068
Depending on current gas fees, it is like 15 usd through lido rn


[2/5/2024 11:15 PM] antonb
Here is an example:
Imagine that on the 1st day there 100 participants who deposited 1 ETH each, that means, each of them have 1% share in the pool and therefore 1% of daily emissions 3456 * 0.01 = 34,56 MOR is the reward for this day.


[2/5/2024 11:17 PM] antonb
I wouldn't overcomplicate calculation with yield and APY as you can get the same result if count in ETH


[2/5/2024 11:19 PM] antonb
There are also pairs on CEXes which is likely the cheapest option
https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether


[2/5/2024 11:20 PM] zj.valz
I see, then can I assume 100% of the yield generated from stETH deposited will be used to farm $MOR during bootstrap phase.

Once Bootstrap phase is over, 50% of the yield will be "farmed' and given to depositors, while remaining 50% will be used to expand $MOR/$ETH liquidity pool?


[2/5/2024 11:27 PM] antonb
Not really. Think of the process like you help Morpheus create liquidity by giving yield generated by your stETH and Morpheus says "thanks guys" in form of MOR tokens, proportionally to contribution of each participant.

All yield that generated for 90 days will be used to pair with 51,444 MOR from 4% of daily protection fund emissions. Thus we will get initial MOR price. 
Starting from day 91,  50% of newly generated yield will be used to buy MOR and pair with another 50% stETH to create Protocol owned Liquidity.


[2/6/2024 1:03 AM] kehndry
Bootstrapping period gives Morpheus 90 days of Steth yield that will seed the LP, simply stated.


[2/6/2024 1:49 AM] paulberg3895
Sorry, don't understand the Part "...and you won't earn any rewards If you withdraw the whole stETH amount".
Can you elaborate? Does it mean people who stake for 90 days and then withdraw the whole stETH stack don't get any $mor?


[2/6/2024 1:55 AM] antonb
If you withdraw previously deposited stETH, you will no longer be Capital Provider and will no longer earn MOR rewards, but what you earned will remain with you.

Would something like this sounds better?

**Do I lose earned $MOR rewards if I decide to withdraw stETH?**
No, you will not lose what you have already earned, but rewards will stop accruing after withdrawal.


[2/6/2024 3:16 AM] moonbuddha
Technically, if you contributed yield at any point, wouldn't that yield still accrue rewards based on your portion of the pool?


[2/6/2024 3:18 AM] moonbuddha
Or would that yield have already been accounted for?


[2/6/2024 3:19 AM] basado8068
This sounds better ofc, however, will you check with team (I assume you are team as well) and incorporate it into whitepaper?


[2/6/2024 3:22 AM] moonbuddha
WP says it a bit better and I think reflects what I mentioned:

"This way all stETH yield earned from your deposit is converted into protocol-owned liquidity (PoL). The yield remains as PoL indefinitely, but you can withdraw your stETH whenever.

As a result, the Capital Provider will receive MOR tokens each day in pro-rata to their total stETH yield contributed"

This isnt clear at all, what is lacking is specifying you cease to be capital provider when you unstake (not the best wording but you get what I mean)


[2/6/2024 4:08 AM] 0xcyber.
After the calculation, seems the APR of capital providers will be around 25% at TGE


[2/6/2024 4:34 AM] smartagents
I'll dig into the Smart Contracts. My understanding was that stETH yield contributed informs the weight of the MOR rewards you earned. And while you won't get more yield weight after withdrawing your stETH, you would still have some weight that gets diluted by others. Let's check the source code rather than speculating.


[2/6/2024 4:36 AM] smartagents
Also its worth noting people seem to be thinking of the boot strapping period as special when it comes to the rewards. To be clear the rewards for capital providers continue for the whole 16 year emissions curve at the same 24% of emissions. The only two things special about the boot strapping period are that the MOR tokens are only claimable at day 91 and there is no price because pool can't start until day 90 when the tokens become claimable.

This is exactly what I have been thinking makes sense - a permanent imprint in staking pool that gets diluted and reaches asymptomatically zero some time after you withdraw. Please check the code, I am unable to do so myself, as I am no programmer. Thanks!


[2/6/2024 4:52 AM] 0xbarry
wouldn‚Äôt really make sense to me that way. I think of it more like exchanging or bonding your stETH yield (if you are familiar with that terminology) for MOR as a one-time transaction

once you‚Äôve contributed the yield it‚Äôs wholly owned by the protocol - you‚Äôve already been rewarded for it once


[2/6/2024 5:04 AM] basado8068
Yeah for me both make sense but I get that what you describe is more conventional way, as I said above the permanent imprint would benefit disproportionately early contributors.


[2/6/2024 5:05 AM] basado8068
Which could be of course a part of game theory - to have most contributors at an early stage of low liquidty.


[2/6/2024 5:27 AM] smartagents
Looks at the testing results the way the Smart Contract devs have coded it up looks like the former. So put in stETH your weight counts in the calculation as long as its deposited and MOR rewards build up you can claim later. However when you withdraw the stETH then the new MOR rewards stop getting added. I suspect this was to simplify the calculation. It also makes more sense if you think of the competition as block by block and not over the entire 16 year period. As that is how MOR are calcuated block by block.

If u stake ur stETH, the amount of $MOR u earn is based ur ur share of the Pool on a block by block basis. (Say u own 1% on that day, u earn 1% of the daily $MOR emissions)

The moment u unstake, (say after 7 days), u will keep all the $MOR earned till date, but no more $MOR will be given to u.


[2/6/2024 12:49 PM] zj.valz
Can I confirm this is the case ^?


[2/6/2024 12:54 PM] mahalleinirx
Confirmed, your stETH will be locked for 7 days, if it is withdrawn after you will stop earning but have what you have earned up to the point

High chances. Here is the quote from the last announcement:

> Next step is for the Public Audit judging to complete tomorrow and for the devs to determine if any last issues need to be addressed before the fair launch. This will tell us if February 8th is the deployment date.

Hi Kalli. There are no admins as other web3 projects have in their discords, but I'll try to help.

[2/6/2024 11:09 PM] kalli7565
Hi Anton, so what I understand from the FAQ is that I change my ETH in a dex into stETH and connect my wallet on the 8th Februari, correct?


[2/6/2024 11:16 PM] antonb
Yes, I'd just add that you could also obtain stETH on CEX or Lido directly, any of the options work.
There will be website where you can connect your wallet and deposit stETH. Initial lock is 7 days, after that you are free to withdraw ay moment.

there's only an intial 7 day lockup. After that, you can contribute more or remove your capital

It will stay in the contract and generate yield which will be used for setting up liquidity pool after the bootstrapping period.

Thanks - and when stETH is contributed, it is only the yield portion that will be split 50/50 between MOR and stETH for the LP? Said differently, if someone contributes 5 stETH, when they eventually withdraw, they will get 5 stETH back (plus the MOR emissions)? As opposed to 2.5 stETH and the equivalent amount of MOR?


[2/7/2024 12:58 AM] antonb

You can buy either on DEX/CEX or stake on Lido directly.
You'll need to connect the wallet with stETH and stake on the website.

Correct, you'll get full principal + can claim MOR earned for the time while your stETH was staked. But claim is only happen on 91th day after launch and your stETH will be locked for first 7 days.

Read the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs FAQ. Tl;dr. 
- Deposit stETH (via ETH) to earn MOR tokens.
- Withdraw your stETH (minus yield) after 7 days.
- Claim your MOR tokens after 91 days.
- MOR tokens are rewarded on Arbitrum.

thanks found it. I was just surprised that auditing only started a few weeks ago and that there was some scary sounding things found by the public audit after there had already been a professional audit by renascence labs.

I guess that's the risk we will take when using a novel bootstrapping mechanism that doesn't have battle tested SCs ready to go

Really hope that SCs are safe considering the mechanism is so novel. It could be wise to wait for a couple days since emissions are going on for 16 years

I hear you, but not a solidity dev, so can't comment, but will tag some folks to have a look when online.


[2/7/2024 6:21 PM] antonb
Personally, I see a three-level audit like a funnel, where after each stage there are fewer and fewer risks. Perhaps the renascence labs audit was aimed at some other aspect of the contracts.


[2/7/2024 7:08 PM] chadamentals
almost like a natural bug bounty


[2/7/2024 7:08 PM] mau08611
Fewer & fewer, but only need one bug to drain or exploit..


[2/7/2024 7:10 PM] mau08611
I was under the impression that this was battle tested first, but reading into it more it sounds quite risky

Genuine question: There are people like David A. Johnston in the core team who literally developed the foundation of "DeFi". How is it possible that the smart contract has this amount of vulnerabilities?

I think its been about 3 months of testing. First by the devs, then by community, then by the dedicated auditor, then by the public testers. Ultimately the devs said they addressed the issues and that its ready, but more testing is always good. Part of the benefit of the boot strapping period is that the 90 days makes it almost a soft launch as the MOR can't be claimed for the next three months anyway, so anything found the next 90 days could be addressed with more Smart Contract upgrades.


[2/7/2024 8:56 PM] smartagents
Agreed. New code always has risk. No getting around it. More testing, rewards for bugs, and keep improving the Smart Contracts is the way.


[2/7/2024 10:33 PM] basado8068
Crucial is stETH safety. It seems there were no bugs that directly affected deposited stETH, is that right?


[2/7/2024 10:35 PM] basado8068
It was more about tesnet mock stETH but these findings should not affect real stETH if I understand correctly (if someone here is Solidity dev please correct me if necessary)


[2/7/2024 10:35 PM] kehndry
That seems to be the case.


[2/7/2024 10:35 PM] 0xskol
this is a serious concern. 

H-03
https://www.codehawks.com/report/clrzgrole0007xtsq0gfdw8if#H-03

the smart contract shouldn't have even gotten to the audit stage with this issue. 

developers shouldn't require an audit to recognize their code holds funds hostage forever. 

am i missing something?


[2/7/2024 10:40 PM] kehndry
I would concur on your point here. Unsure if this was just for testing contracts, albeit, it seems like it shouldn't be. 

The smart contract devs should opine here.

[2/7/2024 10:47 PM] lukasbaal
as far as i understand it, it was the mock contract that was audited for ?some reason?


[2/7/2024 10:48 PM] antonb
They've been in the same repo as mainnet, so white hats covered them as well


[2/7/2024 10:48 PM] lukasbaal
can capital providers still be assured that the correct test contract has been we‚Äôll audited, tested by community members and cybersecurity firms?


[2/7/2024 10:49 PM] antonb

[2/7/2024 11:48 PM] moonbuddha
anyone know how often rewards are distributed / calculated? 

like if i stake 1 eth in the beginning of the day and the total pool size is 10 eth, i own 10% of the rewards temporarily say the pool grows to 50 eth by the end of the day, i own 2% of the rewards. So at what point would you be getting rewards?

@antonb | will not DM you will the deposit contract be under a proxy? in case something goes wrong, can you fix the implementation? because your initial audit apparently allowed deposits to get stuck forever


[2/8/2024 5:02 AM] lemonflex
also @antonb | will not DM you @SmartAgents will the stETH just stay at the proxy https://etherscan.io/address/0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E? When do they get migrated to the deposit contracts that emit rewards

Not boost, but supposedly we can depo for 7-30 days, so how does this scale with rewards?

Deposit is locked up for 7 days, after that you can withdraw, rewards are given out according to the emissions schedule

Good question. NO. Please do NOT send stETH to the Multisig address. That will not provide any MOR token rewards.
Highly recommend you use the Dashboard Inference instead of trying to do the deposit manually on the Smart Contract via an explorer.

lockup is 7 days for initial stETH right? is there a cooldown period when we unstake?

stETH should be deposited on Ethereum mainnet

the bootstrapping period to provide stETH is only 90 days? What happens after that? Will providing capital still get new MOR?


[2/8/2024 3:09 PM] antonb
To take part in Capital Provision you need to have stETH on Ethereum mainnet.


[2/8/2024 3:12 PM] antonb
No, you can provide even after 90 days. After bootstrapping, your MOR rewards become claimable.
Please have a look at #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs to get better sense of the process


[2/8/2024 3:16 PM] kalli7565

Correct. The MOR emissions curve goes for 16 years. Though the amount of the emissions declines slightly every day to create the limited 42 Million supply cap.


[2/8/2024 3:27 PM] jameskc
can we unstake during the 90 days?

You keep MOR rewards for the time you provide stETH (but you stop earning new MOR rewards). You can claim your MOR at the end of the bootstrapping period (90 days) May 9th 2024.

[2/8/2024 7:29 PM] ivellioss
For the pool IS on step 4 we are also plugging the distribution contract or only for the approval step with lido?


[2/8/2024 7:31 PM] taowser
To those who don't know how to approve in terms of Wei - add 18 zeroes, eg. 1 stETH in Wei = 1000000000000000000

Approved several times and every time it took ETH for approving, but APPROVE button doesn‚Äôt convert to DEPOSIT


[2/8/2024 7:36 PM] taowser
1. Get stETH
2. Go to etherscan -> stETH 0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84 and approve 0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790 
3. Go to 0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790 and go to write as proxy and chose function 9 (stake) and enter amount in Wei 

Works like a charm

You can stake then via etherscan

Go step 3 above and  choose pool id 0 and enter desired amount and confirm in metamask.

[2/9/2024 2:28 PM] antonb
@d a d e f u g a Yeah, actually 0.33 not the big amount relatively to 30 000 ETH deposited already, but you can leave them staking and earn maybe 1-2 MOR after bootstrapping period. From some folks calculations, price can easily surge to 50$, so it might worth it.

Am I the only one who thinks the MOR emission is not compelling compared to other staking opportunities like EigenLayer and LRTs?


[2/9/2024 7:22 PM] moditoken
When you run the numbers and $$ estimations it doesn't feel sustainable.


[2/9/2024 7:22 PM] antonb
Let's talk about figures here #üí≠Ô∏±price-talk


[2/9/2024 7:25 PM] moditoken
I'm familiar with the Price Channel. I think it's a topic for this channel since it's relevant for the capital providers. Obviously, we all want the foundation will earn more $$. So devs can build. 

But if we want to keep the Capital providers happy and for the long term, we may need to consider changing the % from 24% to a higher %?


[2/9/2024 7:28 PM] moditoken
My main concern is CP leaving the project to Eigen. For better yield. We have to be competitve


[2/9/2024 7:28 PM] moditoken
Anyway, just sharing my thoughts, would be happy to spark a discussion


[2/9/2024 7:30 PM] antonb
Don't think it's feasible, all the core 4 parties get the same 24%, it's balanced. To favor someone over another implies diminishing someone else, and I don't think that's a good idea. Besides, 80 million in 24 hours speaks against your version.

On the other hand, I agree that additional motivation wouldn't hurt, and that's why there are currently working on adding more assets with better APR than stETH.


[2/9/2024 7:32 PM] antonb
What's the current APY? And I don't really think that Eigen and Morpheus are competitors in any way.


[2/9/2024 7:32 PM] moditoken
Which assets?


[2/9/2024 7:33 PM] moditoken
No APR at the moment, just "Points" of Eigen and LRTs. When you do the math it sounds more than MOR üôÇ


[2/9/2024 7:37 PM] antonb
It's a concept that is working on. There are no specific details that can be shared yet.

they aren't competitors from a market offering perspective. 

they are competitors from a an investor's perspective. 

TCM is interesting to people have want to hold an eth stack. for people who don't want to hold an eth stack, they'll go buy some tokens somewhere.

for people hiding an eth stack, is the return better from EigenLayer (or EigenPie, etc) or is the return better for staking in Morpheus for example.

please let it as it is, adding more stakeable assets with better apr and then likely better mor shares for these would hurt the community imo

Just my personal opinion, is that we need to launch all the components and make them work together frictionless, before making any changes.

yes, absolutely with you


[2/10/2024 4:53 AM] koreep
how does the increase in value of eth -> steth affect MOR rewards?


[2/10/2024 4:54 AM] antonb
Hello koreep. 
Am I right that under value you mean price of ETH?


[2/10/2024 5:45 AM] 1272
it means the yeild people are giving up, will be higher


[2/10/2024 5:46 AM] brain5314
Interesting question, I would guess it doesn't bc the amount of MOR spread among the Capital providers remains the same. But it helps the ecosystem ofc.


[2/10/2024 5:46 AM] 1272
with 100 eth, you should get 2.3k over 3 months. if eth were say, 3200 then your looking at 3k+


[2/10/2024 6:05 AM] sealsby
So with 1 eth I'm looking at 32 tokens in 3 months?


[2/10/2024 6:06 AM] 1272
I am talking about the yeild from lido. with 1 eth i think your looking at ~0.08 per day


[2/10/2024 6:06 AM] koreep
Yes price of eth‚Ä¶


[2/10/2024 6:07 AM] koreep
1 eth = 2400  = 1stETH and so 1 steth = x (MOR)


[2/10/2024 6:07 AM] koreep
So what happens if 1 eth = 6000


[2/10/2024 6:09 AM] 1272
I just explained it. did you not understand?
the only thing it affects is the unrealised yeild from lido. Higher prices means people are "paying" more to stake.


[2/10/2024 6:09 AM] sealsby
How do I know how many tokens will I get if I put in 10k$ at Pooled steth 50k on an average let's say? Can u guide me how to calculate this


[2/10/2024 6:11 AM] 1272
I tagged you in #üí≠Ô∏±price-talk , take a look at the left image


[2/10/2024 6:32 AM] 1272
the standard deviation for unique stakers is 109 eth.


[2/10/2024 7:06 AM] erikvoorhees
Morpheus' goal isn't to maximize yield to capital stakers. The goal is to build a sustainable, long-term network for decentralized AI.  The more tokens given to capital providers, the more dillution to everyone else, there is no free lunch.  

It's also a self-correcting dynamic: if yield isn't juicy enough for capital, some capital will leave, and yield will rise for those who remain.


[2/10/2024 7:07 AM] erikvoorhees
And empirically, with $100m brought in over past 48 hrs, the yield seems good enough

"It's also a self-correcting dynamic" True, but its not an efficent supply/demand curve. if you consider stETH to be illiquid(gas, etc..), there will be a margin of imbalance.


[2/10/2024 7:22 AM] 1272
things like hedgeing and the price of eth will expand/contract the margin.

Hi guys


[2/10/2024 5:09 PM] antonb
> So you lock 1eth and get around 100$ value of MOR?
@Lucky 
It's just a guess and figures.


[2/10/2024 5:09 PM] antonb
Exact price would depend on many other factors


[2/10/2024 5:09 PM] luckyca7_cult
Yeah, I get that - just trying to figure this thing out


[2/10/2024 5:09 PM] antonb
It could be like $100 if there is a huge demand, or be lowers than $20


[2/10/2024 5:09 PM] luckyca7_cult
Overall, it seems that my best bet would be to get in during the fair launch


[2/10/2024 5:10 PM] luckyca7_cult
Fair enough


[2/10/2024 5:10 PM] luckyca7_cult
Thanks for your time


[2/10/2024 5:11 PM] luckyca7_cult
Are there any other extra benefits to locking the ETH now? I can't see the value tbh for holding eth 90 days to get 100$ valuation in MOR


[2/10/2024 5:11 PM] antonb
Some folks look only at MOR return for their ETH deposit, but in $ it's the same APR whatever sum you deposited as there is a liquidity creation mechanic in place

It's already happened two days ago when contracts went live.


[2/10/2024 5:15 PM] antonb
90 days it's the bootstrapping period, after which AMM liquidity will be created and token becomes claimable


[2/10/2024 5:16 PM] luckyca7_cult
Ok, so what you are saying is I can buy the token today and will receive it in 90 days?


[2/10/2024 5:17 PM] antonb
You can't buy until 90 days are expired, you can only earn it by providing code or capital.


[2/10/2024 5:18 PM] luckyca7_cult
Yeah, ok - then we understood eachother from the get go

Ah, ok, just wanna to double check that the misconception didn't come from somewhere written in here

so we basically get Steth and then go to that wallet and send it there? can someone walk me through it please?  and is it too late?

Hi


[2/12/2024 1:40 AM] antonb
The process is simple and intuitive. Connect wallet to the website, approve amount and deposit stETH

I went to Metamask Dashboard then clicked stake. Staked eth on Lido to get steth token then went to Morpheus dashboard and staked my steth token. üëç

[2/12/2024 9:55 AM] 1272
did you approve spending limit on stETH or approve the stake method?


[2/12/2024 11:42 AM] smartagents
Yeah. Have to do both steps. Approve and then Stake.


[2/12/2024 1:15 PM] supnite
hi, is the reward proportional to the amount staked? Where can i find more details?

Hi. There are daily MOR emissions dedicated to Capital Providers and everyone who deposited stETH compete for part of it propotionally. Details are here  #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs

@antonb | will not DM you I put together a basic website (MorStats.info) to start compiling some of the common information asked about regarding capital providers and various tables/analytics. I'm pulling in total stETH contributed, the equivalent MOR earned daily per stETH, emissions schedules, and $MOR price projections at varying market caps and circulating supply vs FDV. Would love to get any feedback on the first draft as well as if anyone has suggestions for what other stats and info would be helpful. Site can be found at MorStats.info. It‚Äôs a rough starting point but thought it‚Äôd be good to have a repository of data and analytics that people keep asking about.

your 90 day price prediction is half of what it should be. circ supply is 622k on that day, I believe you accounted for 1244k

Here is more helpful info https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m8CQ31m2tr6_sanKa1wLeQFfzzXPUCBRN7l0jRFmIs0/edit#gid=0
One of the most common question is how much MOR I'll get for X.X ETH? Would be nice to have kind of calculator, where a user can enter amount he willing to deposit and get daily/weekly/montly/yearly projection.

Hello. Morpheus is launched and you can deposit stETH on Ethereum mainnet to be rewarded in MOR token pro rata to your contribution.
Your deposit will be locked for the first 7 days and MOR token is claimable on the 9th of May.

Not sure what you mean. Could you please elaborate further?


[2/13/2024 9:33 PM] _mrjelly_
does it matter how much eth we contribute/stake?


[2/13/2024 9:35 PM] antonb
The min. amount is 0.011 and no top cap. There more you deposit, the more MOR you get as it calculates according to your share in the total pool. Currently 52k+ stETh is deposited.


[2/13/2024 11:29 PM] chasingdreams4026
Thanks for the feedback. My understanding is that technically the circulating supply at 90 day would be the full 1244K, even though only 622K would be distributed during the boostrap period. Said differently, there would be essentially 622K live in wallets at day 90 but a backlog of 622K additional $MOR that will be retroactively distributed. This math is how the year 1 total emitted ties out to the 5,091,985 per the whitepaper


[2/13/2024 11:32 PM] chasingdreams4026
You read my mind. That's what I am working on now. Hope to have something updated either today or tomorrow where it can be interactive for users to see the results based on their own inputs and assumptions

# stETH and MOR Token FAQ

As day 7 of the Morpheus Fair Launch approaches its best to address some frequently asked questions here so there is an easy place to point people for answers.

The most common questions are:

1. Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus beyond day 7?
**YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 7. 
Every day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards.**

2. Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus past day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
**YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 90. Every extra day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards. In fact the Capital Provider reward in Morpheus goes for the entire ~16 year period of the initial supply curve. So keep earning MOR as long as you like : )**

3. When can I withdraw my stETH?
**Depends on when you deposited them.
The Smart Contract allows Capital Providers to withdraw 7 days from the time of their individual deposit.**

4. Can I deposit additional stETH?
**YES. You can make additional deposits of stETH when ever you like. Each one can be withdrawn after 7 days or longer.**

5. When can I claim the MOR I earned?
**The MOR tokens are claimable / sendable on day 90 (May 8th 2024). Don't be fooled by anyone offering to sell MOR before May 8th 2024. There is no pre-mine, there are no team tokens. The only MOR that exist are those fairly earned.**

6. How many MOR will I earn for depositing stETH?
**This is hard to predict so early on. However there is a website a community member put up that tries to run some of these estimates / calculations. https://morstats.info/  **

7. What can I use MOR tokens for when I can claim it?
**The first utility of MOR is to access Inference / Compute for running Smart Agents. Every person that holds MOR will get a pro-rata amount of access to the Compute offered to the Morpheus network. Think of it as Staking or Hodling for Inference or Intelligence : ) See Yellowstone paper for details. This aspect is still under development, but very actively being worked on by many open source devs. **https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

**Secondly, holding MOR may have lot of other benefits related to projects launch on the Techno Capital Machine. As Smart Agents launch on Morpheus and use the same fair launch approach providing MOR yield to these projects is a very interesting way to support more open source projects to use the same staking Smart Contracts and best practices developed by the Morpheus community. See paper here.** https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

8. Is it better to provide stETH to earn MOR or buy them on Uniswap day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
**While there is a lot of discussion about this question, its impossible to predict as this point. However there is little downside to just doing BOTH. Everyone can earn MOR from their stETH and then on day 90 if MOR is cheap on Uniswap you can always withdraw your stETH and trade it for MOR. **

Oh and there are now 60,000 stETH staked to the Morpheus Smart Contracts. 
Amazing to see all the passion for Decentralized AI. Keeping being awesome.

Sorry for the delay, but I've added in a section showing the total yield generated by stETH deposits (Currently sits at 34.48 ETH and ~$90K USD). This can be found on the morstats.info/staked_eth page of the site

Added in the stETH withdrawn metric (same https://morstats.info/staked_eth/ page). I'll play around with what looks best to toggle between total and daily results, or what the best presentation method is. (427 stETH have been withdrawn in total)

friendly reminder: 
Hedging is a great way to realize stETH profit, without withdrawing.
I'm seeing more and more people taking profit, always a good thing.
Funding rate interest is nice and high.
 ofc be sure to watch the liquidation price.

# Friday Status Update:

Happy Friday! The Morpheus community continues to grow. The Capital Provider Smart Contract is approaching 4,000 transactions. With the average person each adding a single deposit transaction, this metric is a good rough proxy for how many people have joined the Morpheus community the first 9 days of the fair launch. 

After the withdraw function went live on day 7, there was a significant increase in stETH deposits and generally the inflows of stETH continued to outpace withdraws ever since.

The community has generated a lot of cool websites and resources to look at all the data and stats from the Morpheus fair launch. Highlighting a couple of the best links here.

Hi - I want to provide stETH.  In my walllet I have wstETH.  Is this the same?


[2/17/2024 11:57 PM] antonb
Hey. Do you have wstETH on the Ethereum mainnet?


[2/17/2024 11:57 PM] roccobarocco73
no, on Arbitrum


[2/17/2024 11:58 PM] antonb
Deposits are on Ethereum. wstETH it's wrapped stETH for L2 chains.


[2/18/2024 12:04 AM] roccobarocco73
What is the cheapest and fastest route to stETH from ETH on Arbitrum?


[2/18/2024 12:05 AM] roccobarocco73
So this launch is not so FAIR.  The gas fees will deter a lot of people from depositing.


[2/18/2024 12:06 AM] antonb
I believe you'll need to choose one, either fast or cheap. Optimal one could be through CEX or bridge you trust.


[2/18/2024 12:07 AM] antonb
How does Ethereum fee relate to fair equal conditions for each participant?


[2/18/2024 12:10 AM] roccobarocco73
Bungee exchange cheapest gas fee to bridge 0.5 eth to mainnet = 0.16 ETH ($ USD 400!).  Do you think everyone can afford these gas fees?


[2/18/2024 12:11 AM] roccobarocco73
Why not use L2s?  What are these chains for?


[2/18/2024 12:11 AM] antonb
Have no clue about other people personal finance.


[2/18/2024 12:11 AM] antonb
The MOR token as well as liquidity will be on Arbitrum chain


[2/18/2024 12:12 AM] roccobarocco73
oh come on - so you don't have a clue if a gas fee of $ 400 is expensive or not?


[2/18/2024 12:12 AM] roccobarocco73
are  you a moderator on this server?


[2/18/2024 12:13 AM] antonb
Ethereum has been chosen security wise and due to capital availability.


[2/18/2024 12:13 AM] antonb
I have nothing to do that someone can't afford to pay fee or can't find cheaper option.

[2/18/2024 2:06 AM] roccobarocco73
The About page mentions MOR being burned over time.  What are the mechanics for burning MOR?


[2/18/2024 2:07 AM] smartagents
White paper mentions the burning being part of MOR fees paid.


[2/18/2024 2:07 AM] smartagents
Similar to the burn function in Ethereum.


[2/18/2024 2:48 AM] zxsacredxz
MOR will be an L1


[2/18/2024 2:50 AM] smartagents
@SacreD There is no proposal for that right now.
Morpheus is Smart Contracts on Ethereum / Arbitrum
Morpheus is a local LLM, Wallet, Smart Agent software on your computer.
Morpheus network will route Inference / Prompts for power AI requests.
And it gets to spend most of its MOR tokens supporting Compute, Coders, Capital Providers and Community Frontend Builders instead of paying for consensus and execution layers like a Layer 1.

[2/18/2024 2:56 AM] zxsacredxz
Ahh so it does not work similar to bittensor?


[2/18/2024 2:57 AM] smartagents
Bittensor / Akash / Ritual / Edge Llama are providing Compute.
Morpheus users are consuming that Compute via Smart Agents deployed on the platform.


[2/18/2024 2:57 AM] smartagents
They work together.


[2/18/2024 2:57 AM] smartagents
Both are great.


[2/18/2024 3:00 AM] zxsacredxz
Can Morpheus be considered as just one of the subnet project building around Bittensor infra?


[2/18/2024 3:09 AM] smartagents
Subnets are more about training LLM models.
Morphues isn't training any models. But any great models say like Nous Hermes that come out of Bittensor, then Morpheus can use as part of the Smart Agent tech stack.


[2/18/2024 4:03 AM] roccobarocco73
once token launches in approx 90 days, what is further capital needed for apart from LP?


[2/18/2024 4:03 AM] roccobarocco73
and will anyone be able to provide liquidity in the uniswap pool?


[2/18/2024 4:06 AM] antonb
Yes, anyone will be able to add liquidity as this is usual Liquidity Pool.
After the bootstrapping period, 50% of the generated yield will be used to purchase MOR from the market and pair them with the remaining 50% for providing liquidity. This approach ensures constant buy pressure and ever growing liquidity.

[2/18/2024 4:11 AM] smartagents
Plus the Capital Provider MOR emissions continue for the whole 16 year supply curve. So rewards go long beyond the first 90 days. See #üîäÔ∏±announcements FAQ for MOR tokens.

Morpheus Capital provision is in full swing now with outstanding result of 71k+ stETH deposited. I'd recommend to start exploring from #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs where the process explained in details.


[2/18/2024 5:43 AM] roccobarocco73
And this will be on Arbitrum, right?


[2/18/2024 5:44 AM] antonb
Correct, so fees are acceptable.


[2/18/2024 4:01 PM] y22
so the rewards are roughly 0.05 MOR per stETH per day. is that correct?

@antonb | will not DM you Question please sir, do we start receiving daily rewards once we deposited some stETH ? Is the daily rewards the same and doesn‚Äôt depend on the amount deposited?


[2/18/2024 8:00 PM] antonb
Hi. Thanks for your questions.
Rewards calculate every block, so you'll start earning MOR right after deposit.
As you get MOR proportionally to your share in the total deposited stETH pool, the rate can fluctuate and your share being diluted. Good part here that with every new stETH deposited MOR appreciates in value, so you maintain the same APR.
These estimates could help you get the concept better

Emissions are declining over time. Your earn rate basically depends on your share in the total deposited stETH pool.


[2/19/2024 1:21 AM] terminidis9305
So basically  
people the more Steth they remove  from the pool the more you will earn


[2/19/2024 1:21 AM] terminidis9305
Because your percentage is going up

But the value of each MOR decreases.


[2/19/2024 1:23 AM] antonb
There is no team, no founders, no company or foundation. Morpheus is like Bitcoin, run by community in open source style.


[2/19/2024 1:23 AM] antonb

@chasingdreams and @antonb | will not DM you This website says the total supply today right now is a 14,375 emission. But I thought I remember reading somewhere that there wasn't fully emissions during the 90 day bootstrap period. Is it full or partial emisions during bootstrap?


[2/19/2024 3:43 AM] antonb
Emissions started at the same time for all 4'C in full, but on day 90 only Capital/Code can be claimable.

got it.


[2/19/2024 3:47 AM] jabo38.
what happens to the Community and Compute emissions if there is no community building and compute during the 90 day?


[2/19/2024 3:50 AM] antonb
They are simply stored in the distribution contract until corresponding contracts are live. There were some changes in the Yellowstone recently related to compute budget, you can have a look if interested how rewards are going to be spend.

It's default, change for what you think appropriate to you. It can can be the amount you want to deposit

Thank you. Also why are there 3 separate gas fees. Two for moving stETH to MOR and one for smart contract interaction


[2/21/2024 12:48 PM] antonb
On the dashboard website there must be only 2 interactions. 1st when you approve amount and second when you send stETH into the deposit.


[2/21/2024 12:49 PM] hscwk
Where do I see transactions on the website? The 3 I mentioned I got it from MetaMask, seems like the 3rd is for setting max limit

Can you explain the benifits of camelot


[2/23/2024 11:43 PM] 0xstrife
Depends on what you want to do tbh

Camelot provides a pretty intuitive UI for liquidity managers to plug and play - so protocols like Gammaswap, Steer, Jones Labs, etc. might be more inclined to create managed concentrated liquidity for MOR. They have aggregators like OpenOcean routing through their swap UI - **but** I think it only routes through Camelot's own liquidity pools.

They also have Nitro Pools which allow for incentivizing liquidity providers to do things like lock their LP's for a certain amount of time, or until a specific date. This structure allows incentivizing V3 concentrated liquidity positions - or you can just go full range, UNI-v2 style.

Their pools allow you to set directional fees, so POL could earn more ETH instead of MOR by setting a higher directional fee for buying and a low fee for selling (or vice versa? not 100%) which could help grow POL

If Morpheus ever decided to launch an orbit chain they have the infrastructure ready to deploy there, too.

Lots of similarities to Uniswap obviously, but I think those are the main differences off the top of my head

That's useful info. Do they have any services related to fair launch / price discovery?


[2/24/2024 12:16 AM] 0xstrife
They do have a launchpad plugin (https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/or-launchpad#camelots-custom-fair-launch-model), but it hasn't been exercised in some time. I *believe* this is due to a few of their launch partners not launching smoothly & sentiment of those launches reflecting back into the Camelot community. 

It sounded like they were spinning it back up shortly though. I know they have sales w/ a hard cap & fair price auctions...I don't think they have LBP's set up but I could be wrong.

The implied price is up to $7.80 per MOR


[2/25/2024 2:26 AM] antonb
How did you estimate it?


[2/25/2024 2:29 AM] ogfaraday
(99673 stETH √ó 3.3% Lido APR √ó $2981) / 365
capital providers are forgoing $26863 of daily staking rewards to receive 3446 MOR today
That implies $7.8 per MOR


[2/25/2024 2:32 AM] antonb
So it's the price in case if 100% of capital providers MOR will be sold, right?


[2/25/2024 2:32 AM] ogfaraday
yes I think so


[2/25/2024 2:33 AM] ogfaraday
in reality it implies a higher price than $7.8
because they're also forgoing other farming opportunities with the stETH

[2/25/2024 8:05 AM] _barfly
In reality,  let's be real, it's a bad return and usage of your crypto capital. Yes, if you already have eth or steth for X reasons, then sure might as well put it in it morph for a little upside.  But if you have free capital, there are eleventy billion other bets you could make with a lot better ROI.  At 100k steth pooled and only climbing, it's really diluted for MOR emissions unfortunately.  And yes I get that "the project" is earning all your steth earning cheddar to bootstrap for future.  

But your earned MOR will be squat.


[2/25/2024 9:43 AM] smartagents
@BarFly 
Morpheus isn't a token sale, there is no treasury, there is no team to pay. The Capital Provider competition is going to continue for a long long time and the scarcity of MOR will increase as a result. With every stETH added the yield that goes toward buying MOR and the Protocol Owned Liquidity increases.


[2/25/2024 9:45 AM] smartagents
If there had been 100 stETH staked the scarcity of MOR would reflect it, if 10,000 stETH had been staked the scarcity of MOR would reflect that level. With 100,000 stETH staked the scarcity of MOR will reflect that level. Its proportional.

Also its worth pointing out that if you do the calculations the yield contributed from the stETH has an implied price at all of those levels.

Additionally, Bittensor is a Polkadot parachain and Morpheus is not a chain at all.

Annual % on StEth is 3,4%. So 3,4% on 342 million is 11,6 million a year so around 1 million a month.


[2/28/2024 3:41 AM] antonb
Yeah, it's very rough estimate that could fluctuate essentially. 
All the yield generated over 90 days of the bootstrapping period will be used for setting up protocol owned liquidity

I believe all the stETH yield is paired with some of the MOR from the emergency fund, and this 50:50 becomes the creation of the liquidity pool on day 90. Thereafter half of all the yield is converted to MOR, paired with the remaining stETH half, and dumped continue into the pool.

Eigenlayer now has 100bn staked in it. By contrast, Lido has 34bn. 

Question - in the same way the Morpheus TCM contracts allow people to "forego" their LIDO yield on stETH in return for MOR, could the same be achieved with Eigenlayer points? Are there any known technical issues that anyone has looked into that would prevent us from adding a 2nd alterrnative to the TCM to support Eigenlayer?

I haven't yet done a deep dive on the TCM contracts but before doing that, wanted to message here in case anyone is already working on adding Eigenlayer support that I could collaborate with to build it.

You might be right. I'm not gonna argue with you.
Just a few weeks ago approval + deposit tx cost $12-15, now it's much more expensive.
You might want to consider an option of buying MOR from market when it's live on May 8th

[3/6/2024 6:20 AM] bdog1741
Hey Anton, if you don't mind few questions. 

1. Why the idea to use only 7.5% of the bootstrapped yield instead of 100% to pair it with the MOR from the protection fund?

2. More of the bootstrapped ETH will only be added in the event that users add MOR to the LP? What would incetivize people to do so? Are we talking about a uni v3 pool btw?

3. There is another section exploring e.g. LBPs. Is this an actual consideration after Day 90 or so? If so, where would the MOR token for the LBP even come from? 

I might have missed it but is there a discussion with regard to the launch mechanics, in particular the stuff from the github, somewhere ongoing that you can point me to?


[3/6/2024 6:21 AM] bdog1741
Also, i haven't been around for few weeks so might have missed prior discussions on the topic. If so and someone want to link me to these chats, would be appreciated. Thx


[3/6/2024 11:29 AM] antonb
These exceptional questions, thanks for asking!


[3/6/2024 11:46 AM] antonb
I will give a detailed answer a little later. 
Please note that these are still concepts and not something that has been decided.


[3/6/2024 1:37 PM] antonb
As you know, the goal of the bootstrapping period is the necessity to ensure enough MOR tokens in circulation to fulfill network utility, establish rational price discovery, and avoid excessive volatility.

Taking into account the number of stETH deposited and the expected yield generated, Morpheus will face a significant imbalance (several million dollars versus ~51,000 MOR). If Morpheus goes with the scenario of using 100% of the yield and 100% of accumulated from the Protection Fund emissions MOR to create liquidity, it will result in high starting price, which will be advantageous to a limited number of users (those who have access to bots), who will extract the maximum value from this.

Therefore, various options and approaches to forming the initial liquidity are being considered. The two main ones are:
- using a signaling period
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePueeIx2kOM_kDcmxdmNQ3dWhVVBTwTNQ7JEFfeoeYI/edit#heading=h.gef1a3nu9jgv (base doc)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfnIJXGCJWVPNFrXnbHvoZBs2KOauZQZz6GOhAeTCcI/edit (feedback from devs) 

- phased liquidity deployment
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYeWnu3KpQdExwwuKFgGbRl9eajc6oP1poEQZmf7S2w/edit?usp=sharing

The signaling approach is based on the idea that users will be able to declare their desire to sell tokens before the claiming process and receive compensation in wETH after the launch, thereby providing sufficient MOR liquidity to balance the pool and realize an approach where the price can be determined in a market manner providing equal conditions for all participants.

The second model implies a phased addition of liquidity.
The first phase(30 days) implies pairing of 52% of the yield with 100% of MOR in the full liquidity range and adding 48% of the yield in form of wETH as of one-sided supporting liquidity to Uniswap V3, which is going to be gradually transferring (over 100 days) into the full range, which should also ensure fair price discovery and minimize possible manipulations.

I would be glad to hear your comments and thoughts on this topic.

**TL;DR**
- AMM initiation and fair price discovery are crucial for Morpheus
- Protection Fund reserves its allocated 4% of MOR emissions from the 90-day Liquidity - Bootstrapping Phase for initializing the AMM Liquidity Pool
- Only 52% of the emissions released to date will be actively circulating on Day 91
- The AMM Initiation Phase strategy pairs 52% of Morpheus's earned yield with the MOR from the Protection Fund
- The remaining 48% of yield earned by Morpheus is allocated to a Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity range from 0 to the initiation ratio (aka price), adjusted once per week based on market price
- Yield generated by Morpheus from Capital Providers during the 30-day AMM Initiation Phase is periodically added to liquidity
- After the 30-day AMM Initiation Phase, there will be a transition period (known as the AMM Balancing Phase) during which the concentrated Liquidity Support Range (LSR) will be adjusted into the full range liquidity position
- Four launch phases:
1) Liquidity Bootstrapping Phase (Day 0 - 90)
2) AMM Initiation Phase (Day 90 - 120)
3) AMM Balancing Phase (Day 120 - 220)
4) Long Term Steady State (Day 220+)

@antonb | will not DM you - Hi Anton, I‚Äôve got a small capital allocation of funds towards MOR. I absolutely love the concept and delivery of this project but I‚Äôve got to work within means. Capital efficiency isn‚Äôt the best atm. Is there ways I can make my capital count for more on the network?


[3/18/2024 9:53 PM] sb3101
Ie. Does the Morpheus Network support alternative Defi strategies?


[3/18/2024 10:07 PM] antonb
Hi. It's good question. 
Morpheus is still in its nascent stage. We are ~1,5 months away from token launch and contributors have to launch two major pieces of the protocol, Compute providers and Frontend builders contracts.
However there are lot of conversations ongoing about capital efficiency, for instance, integration of more yield generating assets and chains. I'm not sure if there will be any DeFi strategies implemented at the protocol level, but MOR token is ERC-20 so fully compatible with DeFi ecosystem and has massive potential as provide access for free compute.
For example, various services can propose lucrative APRs for staking MOR by users and utilize Morpheus compute resources this way.


[3/18/2024 10:20 PM] sb3101
Thanks for the response. I'm partly glad Morpheus doesn't dilute its core product - it's the closest I've seen to decentralisation in a while. I'll be around for a while üôÇ

# New Dashboard With Wallet Connect Enabled

New Dashboard being rolled out that has Wallet Connect built in.
ipfs://bafybeiacgafgbmfweoq2seam4zmut7ar2okrgccx2xlwhbvvqcbqomcddm/#/mainnet/capital

There maybe some loading issues as the switch over happens. 

Remember you can always check out balances directly on Etherscan here is the link to the Guide. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Morpheus%20Capital%20Providers%20Contract%20Guide.md

# New Morpheus Dashboard URL For Web2 Style Browsers: Dashboard.Mor.org

Mor.org one of the most popular community websites for Morpheus has created a new link to the Morpheus Dashboard.
https://dashboard.mor.org/#/mainnet/capital

This will make it easy for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and other Web2 style browser users to access the Dashboard.

The MOR.ETH ENS address will continue to also host the Morpheus Dashboard, however given its ENS / Web3 / IPFS usage it only resolves for users of the Brave Browser.

capital providers are forging their stETH staking yield

118k stETH √ó 3.2% APR = 3797 stETH per year

3797 √∑ 365 = 10.4 stETH per day

10.4 stETH √∑ 3426 MOR = 0.00303 stETH per MOR

Capital providers are forgoing $10.6 of yield per 1 MOR.  The fully diluted MOR supply will be 42M.  Capital providers are valuing it at $446M FDV.  That's very high.  Especially considering the opportunity cost of farming this instead of LRTs

After careful consideration of this fud, we've decided to withdraw our stETH.  We suggest you do the same.

[3/30/2024 4:33 AM] smartagents
I think the term you are looking for is "For Going".
Yes clearly Capital Providers are contributing their ETH yield to Morpheus to earn MOR.
That is well stated in the Fairlaunch website page, the whitepaper and in the Smart Contracts. That is on purpose.
https://mor.org/fair-launch
As for if $10.6 USD of yield per 1 MOR is high or low, only the market can say come May 8th.
Everyone is free to make their own decision.
There is no group, no company, no foundation here. 
There are no projections or promises of any certain price of MOR.
There is no pre-mine, everyone is earning MOR by providing Code or Capital fairly from day 1.

You are single side staking your stETH.  You are forgoing your yield to receive MOR.  There is no chance of IL on your deposited stETH.  The risk you are taking is that the MOR you receive is worth less than the yield you would receive from just holding stETH or using that $ for some other purpose (opportunity cost).

1. Ethereum still at the top at $52 Billion

4. Polygon shrunk in March to $3.7 Billion
5. OPStack with $2.2 Billion


[4/6/2024 9:59 AM] smartagents
Though its not a totally apples to apples comparison given how high fees are on Ethereum mainnet. 
VS fairly low fees on the layer 2 options.


[4/6/2024 10:14 AM] smartagents
The layers 2s are now doing $25.2 Billion in volume combined. Which is 47.4% the volume of Ethereum mainnet.
But given the faster growth it will be interesting to see when Layer 2s surpass Ethereum. At the current rate of growth it will be 5 to 7 months.

I think it‚Äôs Base.  Even thought the volumes are still lower than Eth and Arb, the growth has been explosive and the new CB wallet will allow users to interact directly with the Base chain with the funds they have on their CB account.  It opens up a huge new user base and an insane amount of capital

[4/6/2024 9:34 PM] lemay22
But even with those numbers, you are still earning the same % APR (or very close) as what you are giving up with the stETH yield

You just earn it MOR instead of ETH

so how will the bot execution be protected? I think the compute providers will have to provide services based on HME homomorphic encryption that will raise the costs but no shell provider is going to be able to provided that as far as I know


[10/31/2023 12:51 AM] smartagents
To avoid leaking private data when sending prompts to the Morpheus peer-to-peer network of Compute Providers, the software should seek to leverage Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) versions of Large Language Models as they are released. Also with the advent of hardware acceleration for FHE in 2024/2025, it's projected that costs for this computation will reach parity with plain text processing.

i'm very interested in this, but i'm admittedly a total noob at doing things this high-level and i'm running into trouble with installing the morpheus node onto linux (I use windows subsystem for linux with ubuntu). 

from the research i've done i see that the node files are written for debian linux, however i've also heard that those files can also work with ubuntu if configured correctly, so I'm currently trying to install morpheus onto ubuntu. 

i've had a few issues with getting all the necessary dependencies, but before even crossing that bridge i wanted to first ask--should i switch to debian over ubuntu, or can i make it work and keep things as they are? i didn't want to re-install a bunch of things but if I have to redo everything anyways I'd prefer doing it now rather than later, haha...

one last thing--(my apologies for the wall!)--but I will very likely have a few more questions pertaining to installing the morpheus node after establishing what distro to run it on... is there a specific channel for these types of questions? or should i keep asking them here?

many thanks in advance! i'm going to be on the struggle bus for a bit so any and all advice is greatly appreciated! i might not know a lot but i'm very excited to be here and learn from some seriously smart people üòÑ

ok well, lets start with a github action that builds it on commit? that is where I look for instructions if all else fails? This is going to be a couple of days worth of work to set up all this, I am still focusedon optimizing and tracing llama.cpp that is used inside of ollama. please provide your build instructions how you build the linux packages? it says electron-bullder is needed, what version are you using and where id you get it from?

Very interested, I read the whitepaper, I'm maybe not gigabrain enough but would the most powerful hardware yield more use to the network and hence be rewarded with a higher amount of MOR tokens?

Also ... while I've set up miners before, I am a bit of a noob ... but ... I am interested in helping with compute  (one 4090 and could add some older gpus too)  

I set up a ubuntu partition on my window 10 gaming rig. I've not run ubuntu in a while and limited know how with terminal... 

I was able to get the .deb file to run and open up the gui of morpheus.  

I also downloaded Ollama via the curl command.   I am not sure how it works beyond this.

That said, I am not sure what to do next. üòÉ  

Is there a wallet built

how do I connect my gpu  (is one gpu even worth it

Hello @Mike D. , for know we can just interact with Morpheus through the App GUI no? I have some setup GPUS in AWS and can't use a desktop GUI. So my question is if it's possible to interact with Morpheus app through command line?


[11/22/2023 10:42 PM] m1337d
I have now llama.cpp and ggml compiling with C++ so we can use advanced template programmig to embed code to run with the agents in the gpu or cpu next to the or inside the llm, this will allow function calls and real time feeds of market data to be fed to the bot. imagine a vector of price information that would be wired into the models memory and updated at all times.


[11/22/2023 10:43 PM] m1337d
that is a good question, I think that would be via the etherum api basically. I am sure there are may tools that allow you to call a given smart contract from the cli?

Then connect wallets, then run compute API for others and earn MOR. Its just the beginning : )

I'm also interested in providing compute, but will need a guide on how to get started


[12/7/2023 9:07 AM] asheoro
saw this on the website

> "To qualify to receive Compute requests a Compute Provider's address must HODL MOR tokens. Requests will be routed to the Compute Providers API pro-rata to the MOR they hodl compared to all other registered Compute Providers."

I'm curious what the minimum hardware spec are and which model will be served? Not all machine will be able to run the 13B or 30B models, but then ppl may want better results than the 3B model (orca:mini3B) provides.


[12/7/2023 9:07 AM] asheoro
what if I have a lot of MOR tokens, but running a minimal model that's not very helpful?


[12/7/2023 9:08 AM] asheoro
seems the model(s) avail should also be used in the calculation. Are users able to target a specific model or must all compute providers run the same model? 

If this is in the whitepaper or on the website, i'm glad to rtfm üôÇ


[12/7/2023 10:31 AM] mahalleinirx
How do we even get MOR to hodl to start to do the compute if it  is done according to the MOR hodled?


[12/7/2023 10:37 AM] smartagents
I think it makes sense if people can run any model they want and it looks like a market place. It looks like the section you refer to is dealing with the "default" scenario where people are just using the default version of the software and haven't selected any specific model. Both should be options. Just use the default and rely on the coordination mechanism (MOR staked to economically align good actors) and those with the tech sophistication to select a model or a distributed inference provider.


[12/7/2023 10:37 AM] smartagents
Good question. That's part of the boot strapping period. Manual weights set for the first 90 days to boot strap the network before all functions / weights / rewards can be automatically calculated.


[12/7/2023 10:38 AM] smartagents
Seems the only way to get out of the catch 22.


[12/7/2023 10:40 AM] mahalleinirx
How does the coordination mechanism work?


[12/7/2023 10:41 AM] mahalleinirx
That is what I was thinking too

Is there a way to mine MOR I came from the idea that maybe running computing will be compensated by some sort of reward ?


[12/7/2023 8:58 PM] asheoro
just checking my understanding of the marketplace dynamic. 

The user would select the model they want to use (smaller models costing less per token) and submits the API requiest.  Morpheus will select which compute provider is first in line to fill the API request  based on MOR token staked weight?

I would suggest reading the white paper in full, but to answer your question the way to mine is to provide compute, there are other ways you can earn MOR outlined to the document, capital for example is another option


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] mahalleinirx
please let me know as well as I am having the same issue unfortunately

[12/8/2023 5:44 PM] kye6666
yeah lol how do we compute  when requirement is to hodl  tokens.  If you only earn mors by providing computing power and there you only earn 1% of burned then this makes no sense hence my question is there a way to mine.

Currently ollama works only for nvidia gpu, working on a solution to provide compute with amd and intel


[12/10/2023 4:08 PM] kblkusamakingdom
So we need nvidia gpu in order to provide comupte to earn  MOR ?


[12/10/2023 7:23 PM] mahalleinirx
Currently ollama only works with nvidia drivers without a work around

Have to use pacman with the amd rocm drivers

Easy for you perhaps but not so for the code illiterate that haven't used Linux distributions before and want to add compute


[12/11/2023 3:17 AM] mahalleinirx
Imo It's important to have as many people add compute as possible as it's the backbone of the network


[12/11/2023 3:18 AM] mahalleinirx
Have you set up ollama and pulled the model you want to use yet?


[12/11/2023 3:26 AM] asheoro
why are the incentives to run a bigger model?


[12/11/2023 3:27 AM] asheoro
is there a channel that is used to discuss the marketplace dynamic? Also, i'm still uncertain about MOR stake weight vs model offered by a node. Are these economics still being worked out? If so, where can I participate?

EDIT: I'll check out the Tokenomics channel


[12/11/2023 3:30 AM] ddv25
I haven't seen anything on github about that, could you kinly help me to do this?


[12/11/2023 3:32 AM] mahalleinirx
Incentives are determined by demand, if the demand from the user base is bigger models then that is what you'll need to run to secure people using your compute


[12/11/2023 3:33 AM] mahalleinirx
Are you running mac or linux debian for the node?


[12/11/2023 3:34 AM] asheoro
makes sense. So i've i'm the only person serving a large model, but only have 1 MOR staked, then i'd still get 100% of the API requests? Are there any other factors to determine who services api requests? (latency, up-time, etc)


[12/11/2023 3:35 AM] ddv25
I am running it on a VPS with the following specs:

Processor: Phenom II X4 965

Ram    16 GiB
Disk    120 GB 2 TB


[12/11/2023 3:37 AM] mahalleinirx
As far as I know it only factors in the amount of MOR hodled after the bootstrapping period but I'm sure it makes sense to factor in other things

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/11/2023 3:39 AM] asheoro
agreed. Someone serving an in-demand model with 99.999% uptime would be penalized for not staking much MOR.


[12/11/2023 3:40 AM] asheoro
but i understand this is a common approach in POS so üëç


[12/11/2023 3:40 AM] mahalleinirx
Typically the Morpheus node is set up to work on debian distro, you can try on Ubuntu and ollama currently needs a work around for amd graphics cards but let's give it a try

regarding staking MOR to a compute node, will external parties be able to stake to the node or only the node operator?


[12/11/2023 4:23 AM] smartagents
If you had an older version of Morpheus you need to delete it and also uninstall the old Ollama and restart your computer to clear the memory.

I've been working on the amd ollama issue, it seems that the amd rocm packages are not supported on linux debian at the moment, so although there is a work around for ollama itself and amd, with ubuntu, there isn't one for the debian, so the issue is still pending, I'll add it to the github to see if there are any others that want to assist, trying to run on debian using ubuntu directiories atm

Rewards are based on real usage (burning of MOR tokens from transaction). No point in running an empty node.


[12/14/2023 12:48 AM] smartagents
No worries. It is not described that way in the paper.


[12/14/2023 1:40 AM] supple_melon
How is usage decided? is the node used for a compute request based off the proximity/closest node that can run the request?


[12/14/2023 1:41 AM] supple_melon
or is it random


[12/14/2023 3:36 AM] smartagents
Transaction that use MOR to pay for Inference for example.

do I have to manually start ollama before starting the morpheus client?


[12/14/2023 8:45 AM] smartagents
Nope. If you are downloading the latest 0.0.5 version it has Ollama installed in the Morpheus package.


[12/14/2023 8:46 AM] smartagents
If fact if you install Ollama separately it will confuse the software.

[12/14/2023 7:45 PM] cybourgeoisie
Still reading through it, but it does sound like the GUI is prioritized. If there isn't a headless version, then maybe that's something worth adding to the repo. Haven't gotten that far yet.


[12/14/2023 7:50 PM] xchsystems
I think a headless version is needed.  We build AI Platforms, and all the GPU resources should be for the AI workload and not consumed by any GUI, most of our platforms go into datacenters where the only allowed access is SSH.  Installing a GUI also screws with NVIDIA drivers and CUDA.

I'd also like to ask about other GPU Vendors, such as the Intel GPU MAX which uses C++, and also the new AI Accelerators on the 4th Gen XEONs (Advanced Matrix Extensions), which are much more efficient at inferencing than the GPU, typically....

Data Prep - CPU
Training - CPU with AMX or GPU, depending on parameter size, <10bn can be done on AMX Accelerator on XEON 4th GEN
Inferencing - CPU

Good point to address more technically. There are some points on Github around "proof of work" for Code, Compute, and Community. Good thing to expand pre-boot strap period.

Thanks! To clarify, does this mean that the router won't be live at launch?


[12/15/2023 10:38 AM] smartagents
The way I read the paper the "Router" has to be post the boot strapping period.


[12/15/2023 10:39 AM] smartagents
Also Morpheus paper says the Router is not mandatory. People should always be free to select their Inference provider directly.


[12/15/2023 10:39 AM] smartagents
Similar to how in Filecoin you can use the default and distribute the storage or pick a Storage Provider directly.


[12/15/2023 10:39 AM] smartagents
Its a market place.


[12/15/2023 10:59 AM] auggiespqr
Yes, I noticed that too, I really like that design. And I also had the same thought regarding the router.

I am still a bit confused about how the exact math will work though. Based on your understanding, will it be something like this?:
Each compute task will have a certain amount of time associated with it based on its difficulty. Each compute provider will prove how much 'time' they contributed, and then earn a pro rata portion of MOR from that day (to be distributed at the end of the bootstrapping period).

One downside of this approach would be that it will be very difficult to keep track of manually in the spreadsheet you shared above if every provider has to share their data every day.


[12/15/2023 11:04 AM] smartagents
Yeah a lot of the work that needs to be done is around automating the proofs for each area described in the paper. The Capital is the eaisest. Code isn't too bad. Its Community Builders (consuming inference) and Compute Provider (offering Inference) that need more work to automate during the boot strapping period.


[12/15/2023 11:05 AM] smartagents
I hear a lot of conversations about both topics. We shall we what people offer up as coded solutions.


[12/15/2023 11:09 AM] auggiespqr
I will think more about this and see what I can come up with, I have a few ideas. For the bootstrapping period, do you think that there will only be a single compute task (e.g. Ollama inference)?

Still no support from ollama with AMD GPUs so will have to wait on that if you want to provide compute there


[12/19/2023 5:14 AM] xchsystems
Inferencing doesn't need a GPU, in fact a GPU is a waste of Power / Cost for inferencing:
Data Prep: CPU
Training: Depending on the model parameter size, this can be CPU, GPU or dedicated AI Chip
Inferencing: CPU

For XEON Gen 4/5, it has a built in Advanced Matrix Extension Accelerator (AMX) which can handle training with models up to 10bn parameters as well as a DL Boost Accelerator Function, and open source models from huggingface are optimised on Intel

The platforms we build are based on Gen4 Xeon and now Gen 5 Xeon


[12/19/2023 5:17 AM] mahalleinirx
Unfortunately there is no support for Intel either


[12/19/2023 5:18 AM] xchsystems
Are you sure?  OpenLLama 3b has been tuned for Intel using the Intel OneAPI software stack


[12/19/2023 5:20 AM] xchsystems
Pytorch also natively supports AMX, no configuration needed, the AMX accelerator is upstreamed to Pytorch


[12/19/2023 5:20 AM] mahalleinirx
As far as I'm aware ollama is only picking up on nvidia drivers by default, I've tried with AMD with no success but you are welcome to try get the node up and running, the more information we get around this the better


[12/19/2023 5:22 AM] mahalleinirx
Also MOR will work by user demand, while 3b models will probably eventually be able to be served I would suggest starting with models on the list which are llama2, minstrel and orca mini 3


[12/19/2023 7:11 AM] smartagents
I think its worth clarifying the current Morpheus Local Install is not the same as the Morpheus Network version software. So while Ollama and what it can use is the current tech stack for local, that's not to say Morpheus Network version won't support a broader set of models, inference, diffusion and so forth based on what can be proven with MOR token payments. There is some work that needs to be done to make this clear. I hear various ideas for implementing this pre and post the boot strapping period.

1. The 0.0.5 model defaults to 14 gigabyte Mistral. So you have to have 16 gigs of RAM minimum on that machine.
2. The 0.0.5 model do to its size you need a faster internet connection.


[12/22/2023 2:50 AM] smartagents
I think for future versions a smaller model is better for starting and then if it can download upgrade in the back to the larger model if the user's machine has the power that would be great.

Just to give more info, installed via ubuntu, didnt seem to have any issues in installation, only on start up. Fairly new to this stuff tho but In trouble shooting I: checked and adjusted the permissions of the ollama-linux executable, checked the mount options for the relevant directories to ensure they are not mounted with the noexec option. checked for any AppArmor or SELinux restrictions that might be affecting Morpheus. Uninstalled, deleted the file, rebooted, redownloaded Morpheus, and reinstalled it. le sigh

Sorry but im a bit confused by this. Here why does it calculate the % of the rewards you earn as a compute provider as the % of all MOR held. Isnt this meant to be pro rata MOR burnt in transactions over a 24 hour period?

@Smej the guide would basically be: 
1. Add your hardware to a network such as Akash.
2. Make your API end points available to Morpheus users for testing.
3. I hear the Akash community is making a Morpheus template, but until then just add or use hardware on Akash.

Furthermore, I did not find any information regarding the "minimum server configuration" or a step-by-step guide. Additionally, I'm not very familiar with the choices related to LLM. Besides, I understand that a compute provider requires holding MOR tokens. During the 90-day bootstrap period, do I need to purchase MOR tokens from an AMM pool myself, and would this result in high costs?

Gm Morpheus community. I've been working on a revised model suggestion for the Compute portion of Morpheus' tokenomics. Here is the paper:

https://defiant-wolfsbane-830.notion.site/Morpheus-Yellowstone-Compute-Model-2ca9b4e7e1374c898937fdbd1b964cc1


The goals were to:
1. Remove the ability for compute providers to game the system
2. Enable users to not pay per inference (ideally, to not pay at all)
3. Achieve efficient, scalable, and sustainable provision of permissionless compute resource without overpaying for it
4. Incentivize low response time and cost competition among compute Providers
5. Minimize number of blockchain transactions (whether L2 or otherwise)
6. Demonstrate an economically sound fundamental demand for MOR

Circulating for community feedback. Posted also in General Chat. Let's keep discussion of it here in this Compute channel.

@Erik Voorhees how does the bidding process work here? is it determined by best performance and tokens hodled? I would have thought it would also be based on the LT price as well but I think the tokenomics have a fixed rate for that depending on the MOR price calculated daily


[1/4/2024 2:38 AM] erikvoorhees
Compute providers in this case simply tell the Router their bid per LangToken (and the LLM under which they're offering that price).  Router takes lowest bid, does liveness check, then connects User with Provider

MOR price is irrelevant, providers will set bids in USD-equivalent


[1/4/2024 2:47 AM] mahalleinirx
I think maybe having a range for the bid compute providers to set for their LT might be a good option, unless they have an actively changing bid price or range other computer providers could simply undercut the other compute providers for that LLM, if the compute provider isn't able to change their bid price in this case at a specific time they will be pushed out.


[1/4/2024 2:51 AM] erikvoorhees
they can change their bid at any time, by updating the router


[1/4/2024 2:52 AM] mahalleinirx
Guess it is up to the compute provider to have something to monitor the bid price change and update the router automatically


[1/4/2024 3:03 AM] jameskc
I only had a very quick skim while at work but if I understand correctly you want compute provider rewards to approach the cost of electricity to run? If this is correct, why would anyone run a node? Apart from interests sake


[1/4/2024 3:10 AM] erikvoorhees
Let's assume nobody is running a node.  Then a Provider can easily set high bid and earn great return. Then another Provider will do the same, etc. 

From this, an equilibrium is established, bringing the cost of compute on Morpheus down to the market rate, but not above.


[1/4/2024 3:11 AM] jabo38.
I‚Äôm really happy to see the protection against Sybil attack. Sooner or later these seem to always happen to a new chain. The paper states that ‚ÄúProviders must have non-zero balance to discourage Sybil attack from Provider side.‚Äù And it‚Äôs also stated that users must have a balance and sign a message to get access to ‚Äúfree‚Äù requests. I‚Äôm wondering if any plans are being made for if these minimums will be set high to low or even weighted and tiered?


[1/4/2024 3:15 AM] erikvoorhees
Good question... the Provider min balance doesn't need to be high, just something non-zero.  This prevents a case where bad actor spins up bunch of compute (or fake/crappy compute), and gunks up the network with bids that are never actually provided, or provided with bad service. 

Requireing non-zero balance just adds friction to the provider, which is okay in this case because provider can handle small friction one time to get set up, but symbil attacker would be somewhat thwarted.  

And as you say, the min balance could be raised in future if needed. For now I think even just 1 MOR would be sufficient.

This all looks great. Might be a dumb question, but in the notes section #2 refers to provider‚Äôs hardware type being irrelevant. Does hardware type refer to brand specific hardware (ie. Nvidia vs AMD GPUs or Intel vs AMD CPUs) not having an impact on fulfilling requests?


[1/4/2024 3:29 AM] erikvoorhees
Yeah it's "irrelevant" to the network. All that matters is "did the inference request get satisfied reasonably quickly, and pass the pass/fail test of the User? 

The reason it is good to avoid questions of "what hardware is provider using" is because if Provider has great hardware but is simultaneously satisfying a hundred requests, the response rate will be worse than someone with crappier hardware but only returning one request. 

What matters is a) was the correct LLM used, and b) was it provided relatively quickly.  Hardware, in this case, is irrelevant.

[1/4/2024 3:40 AM] erikvoorhees
Few ways to handle that question, I don't have a strong opinion. Maybe a limit should be optional? Feedback from real providers would be helpful here if this was a pain point. 

Probably the Router should be smart enough that it isn't sending a second job to the first Provider if another Provider at same price exists.  

Or, the Provider could just not respond to the liveness request if it's already busy.


[1/4/2024 3:41 AM] erikvoorhees
Can you explain what you mean? Where the Provider hosts his hardware doesn't (shouldn't) matter.


[1/4/2024 3:44 AM] jameskc
That sounds better. Why the mention of getting rewards down to base electricity etc. I think that part completely throws out the meaning of the proposal


[1/4/2024 3:48 AM] taddymason1
Making it optional seems best. I‚Äôm not the most tech savvy person, so maybe having an automated option could be better for users like me (ie. a setting that runs a hardware scan and based upon previous performance data gives recommended settings for the user based on their setup. Obviously this might not be feasible at launch but something down the road to consider). And then having an advanced option to customize settings for providers who have stronger technical background.


[1/4/2024 3:49 AM] erikvoorhees
Compute is a commodity service, and will fall toward cost of electricity naturally in the market (whether Morpheus or elsehwere).   And this is good! The cheaper Morpheus can offer compute, the greater the reason to use it. 

The Yellowstone model just embraces this reality of compute falling in cost over time. The network (its users and its MOR holders) benefit from that reality over time.


[1/4/2024 3:51 AM] erikvoorhees
If a Morpheus Compute Provider is bullish on the network growing, the smart strategy is to offer compute at slightly below-market rate, earn $X worth of MOR in early days, wait for network to grow, and then benefit from scarcity of MOR.  

MOR is scarce. Compute is not.


[1/4/2024 3:53 AM] erikvoorhees
And the reason to hold MOR is thus to get access to below-market pricing on permissionless compute.  In the Yellowstone model, you don't need to spend (lose) the MOR, just hold it. Holding it grants ongoing right to pro-rata portion of the compute that the network can pay for.

So the earlier you provide compute (and continue to consistently), the higher priority you have due to past performance of quality response of RFCs?


[1/4/2024 4:00 AM] erikvoorhees
No - the earlier you provide compute, the earlier you'll earn MOR. 

The way a Provider is prioritized is purely based on his bid price.  If lowest bid then you get next job.  And if your response is too slow, or User gives it a fail, then you don't get paid for the work you did (this prevents low bidders from degrading quality or faking things)

Could  a compute provider offer at no-cost to be the lowest bid and then at the same time be the user of the network so he is earning more MOR 

Provide compute -> lowest bid -> be the user -> your node is the one taking on the task ?

With no bid Provider wouldn‚Äôt make MOR

What were you thinking of as the router? you mentioned something centralized that would be decentralized ultimately but what does that look like?


[1/4/2024 12:11 PM] emersondickie
So it is dependent on users paying in MOR to earn MOR ? 

It seems that being a compute provider may be without an incentive for quite some time until the network develops


[1/4/2024 12:47 PM] mahalleinirx
Incentives are MOR tokens and a step towards the decentralized future


[1/4/2024 12:52 PM] emersondickie
So anyone who is a compute provider (spins up a node) earns MOR ? Thought that wasn‚Äôt the case.


[1/4/2024 1:13 PM] smartagents
To be clear there is a deference between the block reward (MOR emissions) and user fees paid in MOR.
The Yellowstone paper is dealing with the question of MOR rewards from block emissions.
In other words the minting of MOR from the 24% of the protocol rewards that go to Compute Providers.

So lets use a real world example. The first day 3,456 MOR go to the Compute Provider rewards.
If someone says. 
1. Hi I'm a Compute Provider XYZ and I bid 10 MOR to provide 10,000 LangTokens. 
2. User ABC with a MOR balance requests LangTokens and XYZ has the lowest bid.
3. The Router matches the User with the Provider and credits XYZ with the 100 MOR tokens, presuming 
A. They pass the lively test and 
B. The User ABC doesn't fail their output.
4.  XYZ can claim their MOR later by interacting with the Compute Smart Contract.

So now 100 MOR have been used from the Protocol's 3,456 MOR available MOR that were emitted that day.
Users can continue making requests, limited by the total LangTokens available and their pro-rata right to them based on their MOR balance. Now if a user runs out of LangTokens available based on their MOR balance they can either buy more MOR tokens or just pay a fee in MOR to get more LangTokens from those offering them to the Morpheus network.

My quick thoughts to Open Question 1: How should the Compute Budget be determined? (yellowstone paper)

I know this was just a suggestion, but i believe it should be utilized to enhance rewards for other providers, such as code and capital contributors, rather than being passively distributed to holders. I think distributing it among all holders might spread it too thin. also, it may resemble a security, since there's an expectation of receiving more coins simply by holding some. In contrast, with other allocations, it's not about expectation, but a reward for contributing work. I'm not an expert in security laws and im not really trying to go down that rabbit hole, but most importantly I'm really just trying to think of the simplest solution. so that one day this system can be universally adopted and a mor ETF can be made or something with no issues lol.


[1/4/2024 1:26 PM] smartagents
Yes, this is an interesting question.
"These could, perhaps, be granted pro-rata to current MOR token holders. Or, they could be burned. Or, they could remain unused in the Compute Contract, to be spent in the future on Compute (but then this opens more governance questions)."
Out of the ideas included here I lean toward extra MOR not used each day being available for future demand. That way the MOR which can be used for LangTokens grows over time. This creates a solid utility for holding MOR which is using the LangTokens as is the purpose of the network.

I'd rather not go down the endless debate of using the MOR, which is for Compute Providers to any other purpose. 
Down that road madness lies.

This is how I thought it worked. This is why I was confused when I heard compute providers would have to service end-users to earn block-reward/emissions (I didn‚Äôt see how that made sense when thinking of how blocks & block rewards work)

I see you edited the post. What you‚Äôre describing sounds like something along the lines of being an LP. 

Are LangTokens some sort of credit/gas system for users ? I don‚Äôt remember hearing of LangTokens. 

What are LangTokens


[1/4/2024 1:34 PM] smartagents
I believe LangTokens are a new term introduced by the paper. I actually think this term can be improved upon as "Language" is specific to Inference. But some term for AI Tokens / Compute Tokens is best. It refers to the basic atomic unit in AI. Look at the Open AI pricing page and its all USD per "1,000 tokens". All AI models use tokens to define the requests sent to them.

@verisimilar does this work beyond inference? Morpheus is intended to be use case agnostic. Just thinking out loud about the best atomic unit here that with cover as many use cases as possible. For example I expect AI Video to be the majority of usage over time. Does that use case which I suppose is diffusion based map to the BPE Token term? It would need to Pixels, Bitrate, Frame-rate, instead of BPE Tokens right?

This was a great update thank you @Erik Voorhees 

I did want to come back to the point @EmersonDickie made in which you responded 'With no bid Provider wouldn‚Äôt make MOR'

Why would they not make MOR? if i am a compute provider offering it at 0 cost i would get prioritised as i am offering the lowest bid per lang token in MOR (if we are assuming it cannot be 0 then take the same example with lowest non zero bid) 

Providers are doing this in order to earn as much MOR as possible, i don't actually think in @EmersonDickie example being the user also actually makes any difference to the provider as being the lowest bidder would prioritise all user requests to you anyway so there is no advantage of also being the user. 

I also appreciate that if a provider is willing to provide compute at lower than his cost in an attempt to speculate on MOR tokens appreciating that this is in a way healthy for the network, at least initially, as it creates the lowest cost possible for users (bootstraps) and over time you would expect this to reach  the base cost of electricity as suggested.

I have a bunch of dedicated servers for my own projects. Did I understand correctly I can just run some nodes and earn some tokens? Any TLDR for what to expect per server? I see a compiled debian package, has anyone run this in docker (especially on an ubuntu host)?


[1/5/2024 12:49 AM] asheoro
"Holding it [MOR] grants ongoing right to pro-rata portion of the compute that the network can pay for."

This is very similar to the original resource allocation model of EOS. The % MOR tokens held guarantees the holder the ability to access the same % of the network's resources (i.e. compute) without having to spend the MOR tokens. Also very similar to how "voting power" was managed in Steem. Granted, it required the user to stake the tokens. 

Is this aligned with you Erik? If so, how is network compute calculated? 

I assume this means there's some cooldown mechanism @Erik Voorhees before those MOR tokens are "re-activated" on their resource claim?


[1/5/2024 1:01 AM] asheoro
i'm still unclear about "LangTokens" and how the compute-provider bids are filled.  Do MOR tokens emit an off-chain asset called LangToken that is burned based on the # of tokens required to service the inference requested? Or are LangTokens an accounting unit inside the Compute Contract to allocate MOR?


[1/5/2024 1:05 AM] asheoro
if we assume that compute-providers are only rewarded via inflation, and not thru direct payment revenue, it could make the system more fragile depending on the price of MOR. OF course this is similar to how Bitcoin was bootstrapped so my fears may be overblown and supply/demand would shape the compute vs MOR price balance.


[1/5/2024 2:11 AM] mahalleinirx
LT are from my understanding a fixed amount of compute represented as a token, but not actually a ERC20 like MOR


[1/5/2024 2:12 AM] asheoro

[1/5/2024 2:19 AM] asheoro
otherwise an attack vector may open up where a very small # of input tokens could result in a very large # of output tokens.

I have a really simple question. 

For quite some time, in the beginning, to at least some degree, there  will be no users. If there are users, it will be very very little. 

As a compute provider, is earning MOR as simple as setting up a node and earning block-reward emissions? 

I am hearing things that sound like people are not all on the same page.  

Hearing some say compute-providers do not earn unless there are users (which I do not understand. A block occurs on a continual basis and compute providers earn a ~24% portion of block reward on that continual basis)

Do compute providers earn MOR block reward emissions on a continual basis ? 

If it is based on users, what about when there are no users or virtually no users ? Are compute providers earning MOR emissions still? Or the 24% portion of block reward just doesn‚Äôt go to compute providers ?


[1/5/2024 3:42 AM] mahalleinirx
The way that yellowstone model deals with this is that it is based on usage and the rest of the tokens from that days emissions is an open question of whether or not that will be burned, given out to MOR holders or something else, so they rewards for being an early compute provider is that you will be earlier to the rewards, the old model had pro-rata rewards out of the bucket given to the compute provider, if you are one of 100 providers and your inferance is used you'd get a % of the bucket


[1/5/2024 3:42 AM] mahalleinirx
The more MOR you hodled the higher priority of being used in the old model, so this might be where a lot of the confusion is coming from


[1/5/2024 4:42 AM] antonb
Will add my 2 cents. @Erik Voorhees thanks for your work.

I don't think that approach when user pay nothing is scalable in the long run, I'd suggest kinda freemium model when user gets limited amount of queries daily, based on MOR amount in possession and in case when it's not enough, it can buy additional LT for MOR. Thus we ensure healthy economic cycle.

How does that sound to you?

In Yellowstone model, for Compute bucket, there is no conception of burning anything.

User: has MOR, and each MOR gets him X number of LangTokens (inference requests) processed per day. User *does not spend* MOR when he wants inference requests. MOR is like the EOS gas concept in this regard @Ashe Oro  

Note: LangToken is short for "Language Token", and is NOT a crypto token. Language Tokens is just the atomic commodity unit of LLM inference.  See OpenAI's API... they charge like $0.002 per 1000 tokens (token = langtoken).  Tragically, the crypto term "token" collides with the AI term "token" üòµ‚Äçüí´

In Yellowstone model, "spinning up a node" doesn't earn you MOR.  MOR is earned solely for actually processing inference requests for users. 

This is one of the vulnerabilities I saw with the original model. If "spinning up a node" earns MOR, but doesn't actually do anything economically productive, then the network is subsidizing meaningless effort: a bunch of people will get MOR dropped to them. 

From the network's perspective, it wants compute available, but importantly it doesn't want to *overpay* for any given level of demand. If there is $10k of real inference demand on Monday, and Morpheus paid out $250k of MOR tokens to all the compute providers, that is wasted economic value... and a cost to all MOR holders. Yes, those receiving the airdrop will always love the airdrop. But does it help build a sustainable network of compute resource?  I doubt it. 

So Yellowstone tries to address that by paying only for compute used.

Good question Emerson:

- In original Morpheus model, Providers earned MOR simply for turning on a compute node and telling the network it existed. If you spun up 10 nodes and 100 existed on the network, you'd get 10% of the Compute bucket tokens (which is 24% of all MOR emissions).  IMO, this was a problem, because the *quality* of that compute doesn't matter (an A100 is paid same as a nvidia 1080), and also because providers are paid whether any valuable work is done or not, which makes it very easy to game.  Everyone would spin up nodes, take as much of the MOR pie as they could get, the network would have orders of magnitude more capacity than it needed in the early days, and this capacity vanishes later on when its actually needed. 

- In Yellowstone revised model, Providers earn MOR only when they process an AI inference request. They bid on "LangToken" production ("I will provide inference units for $0.001 per thousand"). If they are lowest bid, they get the next job, complete it, and then are paid MOR so long as user received the result quickly and it passes a pass/fail test.   In this model, the *quality* of the compute matters, and it drives down cost for the network instead of overpaying. Much harder to game, and imo much more resilient for an actual long-term decentralized AI network.

[1/5/2024 11:14 AM] erikvoorhees
A critic will say, "okay but then much fewer Providers will exist" and to this I would say, "correct!"  If original model had orders of magnitude too much compute (with no concept of quality or response time) then we indeed want something that reduces compute supply back toward compute demand.  Yellowstone conceives of a bid process which means there is *always* compute available, it's just a question of at what price. The network will always pay that lowest price with MOR emissions, and the User gets the result without spending anything. 

The user can only take advantage of this resource, however, in proportion to MOR tokens he holds. This prevents tragedy of the commons, and makes it very valuable to actually hold MOR tokens.

Yes you are describing how it works! User gets limited amount of queries for free, daily. That amount is based on how much MOR he holds.

[1/5/2024 11:19 AM] erikvoorhees
Think of each MOR as representing your ability to access a portion of free AI compute, every day, indefinitely. If that sounds valuable, MOR tokens get bid up and held, which increases the ability of Compute Contract to pay higher amounts of processing power.

Really enjoyed the post @Erik Voorhees and great suggestions. I have a few thoughts. It will be quite the long message, I'll have to split it into multiple ones here lol.
I'm mostly just thinking out loud, so take everything with a grain of salt, but happy to expand / discuss more! Also not sure if all of the below is even relevant / critical to think through.

1. I don't believe that the router even needs to be decentralized. It's a similar role to a relay imo. What we need to solve for is trustlessness, privacy and CR. Obviously, we can get that through decentralization, but I think approaches like putting the router into a TEE is way simpler. The risks associated with TEEs are also bearable considering the limited payoffs of attacking the router. I think decentralization would be overkill and come with too much complexity, and probably reduction of UX through additional latency. 
2. Batching also seems reasonable to me. It's even fine to just have a provider-specific batching of payouts every n time interval or even every x passed queries, probably the former being better UX for small providers. Batching only introduces a delay for payouts for providers, which is totally manageable for them, but obviously reduces gas costs of the overall system considerably.


[1/5/2024 2:08 PM] robind57
3. Let's dive into the "user pays nothing" goal. So in this design you shift the barriers to entry to the initial onboarding, as the user needs some MOR to get maxLT and some priority. This is obviously way better UX than having to continuously pay, totally agreed. At the same time, the protocol ends up paying in the form of subsidies. How do you guys think about sustainability of such a model? I guess one could argue that from a system perspective the emissions (cost for holders) are equivalent income to providers (e.g. like Jon Charbonneau likes to argue in a PoS context). However, there's no way for normal token holders to participate in this upset and it only goes to a small subset of ecosystem participants (providers). You also don't want to implement a staking / delegation framework, as, like outlined by Erik, the prioritization of providers should not happen based on stake.
   In any case, a great way to bootstrap!
4. Do you guys think it still makes sense to consider having the structure that requires the provider to burn a small amount of MOR for each query? Otherwise it might make censoring easier. What I mean is that it's impossible to tell whether a provider couldn't solve a specific query, whether the provider didn't receive it or whether it's censoring. It might be annoying if you hit multiple trolling / unresponsive providers in a row. I'm not sure how much latency we'd speak, obviously to a certain degree it won't matter. Having a cost associated with it will incentivize providers to not take on more than they can chew and also tackle such concerns.
5. In the context of CR, maybe the router, especially if it's in a TEE, could publish a list of "seen queries" regularly too. It can act as a source of truth. Not sure if necessary. Fancy alternative structures here include using something like dYdX with vote extensions, but that's probably overkill for quite a while.


[1/5/2024 2:09 PM] robind57
6. Does Morpheus care about the "quality" of requests? Probably too subjective and therefore not credibly neutral. I'm just thinking if there are obvious cases of spam (shit load of requests within a very short period of time) then those are clearly not organic. Spam obviously gets limited by the maxLT. So the reply might just be "It's totally fine if each user always goes up to the maxLT in a short period of time. Such spam is acceptable". The user's ability to spam is given endlessly, up to the maxLT limit. Could it make sense to either have the ability to slash such users (comparable issue in PoW attacks vs PoS attacks) or maybe throttle the maxLT for a specific user? If we go back to the point about router being in a TEE then such a throttle mechanism would be auditable and transparent for everyone. It can be programmatic, e.g. "x requests in n time are considered spam and will result in the router throttling your requests". As in this case it would still be one router it should be simple
7. While falsely failing a provider does not come with an incentivize, does it come with any punishment? Griefing attacks to have providers waste compute might be fun enough for some bored users

[1/5/2024 9:55 PM] asheoro
since a MOR holder has purchased usage rights, should it be considered spam? Seems similar to the ongoing Ordinals debate (and previously the CounterParty debate in 2016). Essentially nothing is spam.


[1/5/2024 10:24 PM] robind57
Yeah exactly, definitely seeing that as a totally valid reply and probably don't want to introduce a mechanism that loses credible neutrality.
Only potential exception imo is if some excessive spam in a very short period of time might have an effect on the performance of the network. That's easy to spot and would actually cause damage. But I'm not sure if that's even a realistic outcome


[1/5/2024 10:30 PM] asheoro
seems it would result in compute providers increasing their prices to work thru the "spam" txs. I'm not belittling the issue @RobinD57 , just dont have a good solution...it's one of the reasons (imo) that the EOS ecosystem became irrelevant. There was a whale controlling loads of CPU resources and "spammed" the network for a year causing a spike in resources required to use the network. Game theory says that the whale has the most to lose due to making the protocol unusable (or at least with worse UX)

This is why i was asking about a cool-off period for using MOR tokens and how that is tracked. And if these token should be staked, but maybe i'm introducing complexity.


[1/5/2024 11:49 PM] erikvoorhees
Thanks for the great thoughts @RobinD57 !

"I don't believe that the router even needs to be decentralized. It's a similar role to a relay imo. What we need to solve for is trustlessness, privacy and CR."

Yeah maybe true... I'm approaching this from perspective of "get something working quickly, then adapt/improve over time".  Router should launch however is reasonably fast and secure, and the community can figure out best way to refactor router with time (maybe multiple implementations will exist). 

"Batching also seems reasonable to me"

Yeah I think critical. We can't have an architecture where each LLM inference = 1 blockchain transaction (even on L2).  In Yellowstone, Providers simply call the contract when they want a payout, and they are responsible for gas costs. In practise, Providers will likely call once a day or every 2 weeks or something, and then gas is insignificant relative to all the queries performed. 

"Let's dive into the "user pays nothing" goal. So in this design you shift the barriers to entry to the initial onboarding, as the user needs some MOR to get maxLT and some priority."

The reality will actually be even better for many users.  Imagine an app which is "the User". The app holds MOR.  The app then lets users access Morpheus compute with whatever terms it wants (freemium, credit card subscription, paid with ads, whatever). In this structure, normie user of the app never needs to hold MOR or care about it, so friction is reduced to zero.  Apps in this way can be Users, and they in turn aggregate normies in their UX.  A "User" in Yellowstone context is just any party that has MOR and sends inference requests... often it will be apps fulfilling this role. 

"from a system perspective the emissions (cost for holders) are equivalent income to providers"

This is the right way to see it. The costs of network compute are born by the token holders as a hole, and the counter-balance to that is that token holders get access to the compute for free. From these relationships, an equilibrium should form. 

" What I mean is that it's impossible to tell whether a provider couldn't solve a specific query, whether the provider didn't receive it or whether it's censoring."

In Yellowstone, all forms of censorship or "bad performance" are screened with the User's pass/fail check. By default they Pass, but User can set to Fail and then Provider doesn't get paid. Occasional false fails shouldn't matter, as each compute job is small/low cost and it'll come out in the averages. 

"In the context of CR, maybe the router, especially if it's in a TEE,"

What are CR and TEE? Sorry i'm dumb

"Spam obviously gets limited by the maxLT. So the reply might just be "It's totally fine if each user always goes up to the maxLT in a short period of time. Such spam is acceptable".

Correct. By limiting each User's requests to their pro-rata share of MOR held, we can ignore all concepts of spam which avoids tons of issues. If someone wants to burn all their requests per day on nonsense, that is their right. 

"While falsely failing a provider does not come with an incentivize, does it come with any punishment?"

Currently no. Open to suggestions on this, but I'd suggest we wait to see if it actually emerges as a problem before engineering a solution for it. Remember that a "griefer" here is already someone who bought/owns MOR... kinda silly to grief one's own financial interest in a system. Will it happen sometimes? Sure. If frequency is low enough, it can be ignored.


[1/5/2024 11:51 PM] erikvoorhees
This looks cool but is beyond my mental acumen!


[1/5/2024 11:53 PM] erikvoorhees
In Yellowstone's model, running a Compute server on its own won't earn you MOR.  You earn MOR only when that server completes actual inference work for a User. Providers will bid (as low as possible) to get the next job from a User. My guess is that Providers will bid close to zero, even below cost of electricity, in order to get MOR in early days at low price.  The result of this is extremely low-cost compute for Morpheus users, and potential to outcompete any big tech firm. This is the bet, actually.

A User that doesn't have MOR would need to use some intermediary app that lets them access morpheus on the app's behalf.  From the network's perspective, a User *must* have non-zero MOR balance.  From an app's perspective, it could hide this requirement from its own users to enable amazing frictionless UX. 

"LT price locked daily"... probably not locked? Probably changing constantly based on Provider bids, and coalescing within a small range close to cost of electricity.

Right. And to Erik's point above 99.9% of users are likely to be application or Smart Agent developers who hold the MOR. How the users of their Dapps or Smart Agents access their product is up to them.


[1/6/2024 2:01 AM] smartagents
So the friction for the average person should be zero.


[1/6/2024 2:05 AM] asheoro
if a large % of MOR is held on an exchange,  does that mean that a large % of Morpheus total compute will be unused?


[1/6/2024 2:09 AM] smartagents
That's a good question. Though I don't know if I would call it technically "un-used". There would be a growing capacity of MOR in the Compute Smart Contract that can be ready to provide resources to pay for BPE Tokens / Inferences (what ever it ends up being called) for users to pull from as needed.


[1/6/2024 2:21 AM] asheoro
Asked differently: 

Based on MOR tokens held, each address is assigned a UserMax each day. UserMax represents the  address' access to an amount of BPE/LT for that day.  Per the Yellowstone paper "In reality, most tokens will sit in wallets and exchanges, and only a fraction will be used to demand the LT production."

If MOR tokens give the holder the right (but not obligation) to use a % of compute, does this result in idle resources if not used? If so, are these idle resources available to other users at the risk of no longer being available to the original MOR token holder who has the right?


[1/6/2024 2:38 AM] smartagents
I think the Yellowstone approach will have less "idle" capacity than the original model. Again Morpheus Compute providers are likely to only offer an amount of Compute they think will be used. As usage increases it should attract more Compute Providers.


[1/6/2024 3:15 AM] emersondickie
If compute providers earn based on being a supplier/provider to end-users  , where will the 24% of block reward go when there are no/virtually-no users ? Is the block reward emission completely re-orchestrated in how it is handled/emitted ?

Also, you mentioned the quality of the compute can become problem with og model because someone can run A100 and earn same as someone else running Nvidia 1080. Isn‚Äôt there some simple way to handle that ? Early on if a 1080 is sufficient based on networks users/usage than that is what CP‚Äôs will run but as network scales in usage and users than of course a 1080 won‚Äôt work anymore. So I don‚Äôt see how that problem exists unless Morpheus doesn‚Äôt have way to naturally handle this. If a CP doesn‚Äôt have sufficient compute then they will have to upgrade otherwise they don‚Äôt earn (I would think)
 A person running an A100 when the network doesn‚Äôt need that isn‚Äôt being smart. A person running a 1080 when it is not enough isn‚Äôt smart or doing things optimally. Most-optimal = most rewarded

I guess the main question is what happens to the 24% portion of block reward that was designated for CPs ? Do they just not emit on a continual per-block basis and only emit based on a different approach that calculates emissions on per usage/users etc? Why even have emissions for CPs if they are earning solely based on end-users ? I guess for bootstrapping network/user-base and being able to charge users at much cheaper rates because block reward subsidizes cost.

And let‚Äôs say someone is running a 1080 and another is running an A100, how does the network reward the A100 more than the 1080 in this model ? If it is based on servicing end-users. This model should mean a 1080 can earn so long as they have necessary compute to service end-users. They will just not be able to service as many users at scale as a CP with an A100.

What happens if a CP doesn‚Äôt fulfill a user-request ? How does the network handle that.

This is a valid arguement. But not one that I am quickly compelled by. Analgous, I think of the case of a hostile takeover where the subject gets stripped for its parts or dissolved on the grounds of it being a competitor to the purchaser. Akin would be buying up MOR, accumulating usage rights and spamming it into oblivion with negative intentions.. .that latter reasons can be implied quite obviously. 

I think to this point the quesion is despite ownership, does intent matter, and who is the governor of intent should it matter.

If they want to waste money buying lots of MOR and holding it so they can send "I'm the Emperor of the Sky" to themselves 1,000 times, go for it." The Compute Providers got paid. The Router doesn't care.


[1/6/2024 6:26 AM] smartagents
It didn't cost any other users anything and no one sees it but themselves.


[1/6/2024 6:26 AM] smartagents
The key is the Pro-rata limit.


[1/6/2024 6:27 AM] smartagents
The attacker can only ask for AI Tokens up to the amount they are allowed to by the pro-rata of their MOR tokens.


[1/6/2024 6:27 AM] smartagents
The bigger the Morpheus network grows the more costly the attack becomes.

[1/8/2024 5:48 PM] robind57
Thanks a lot for the in-depth reply and sorry for the delay. I was a bit busy during the weekend.

- CR and TEE as censorship resistance and trusted execution environment (e.g. Intel SGX). Sorry for the laziness lol
- Totally fine to launch the router in a fully centralized way imo. Then explore multiple implementations in the future. I see this playing out in a similar way to relays in the mev supply chain or sequencers on L2s. I would say that here mainly two properties are important: Trustlessness and liveness. We can achieve both in a way simpler implementation over time than directly going full decentralization, which comes with a bunch of challenges and difficulties. Trustlessness through TEEs (or similar tech). Liveness can also be tackled quite well by just having a back up router initially. Similar to the discussions around how rollups could already have a slightly incentivized back up sequencer that steps in in case of liveness failures of the main one. Alternatively, something like distributed validator technology, applied in a very simple way, if geographical distribution is important too.
  Over time it can then be assessed whether a fully decentralized router is truly needed. But yeah, nothing to worry about for now.
- Great point about "Users" also being other apps, who can then set up their own monetization structures. That's an interesting point and I somehow only considered direct usage, but you are 100% right and that's quite interesting


[1/8/2024 5:48 PM] robind57
- I also like that the AccessRate takes the token price into consideration. As when we structure products that require tokens to access, one of the problems often is if access is denominated in the native token and those models often don't account for price as an "external" data point. Over time it then becomes either too expensive to join or early buyers got dumped on heavily. The project then needs to decide whether they want to change the access requirements (e.g. reduce less tokens in a bull or more in a bear), which has an impact on either token holders of product users. Generally, really bad UX. In this model everyone knows how changes of the price will impact their MaxLT and it won't require any "repegging" in the future, which is nice.
- Agreed about the spam related points too. I think giving it some thought before it becomes a potential issue is beneficial, to be able to act quickly if required. However, definitely not a priority now

Hello guys, which VPS do you recommend to run compute?


[1/9/2024 2:54 AM] antonb
I see it as a way to "buy" MOR, you either buy it from open market or through providing computing. I'm eager to see the game theory in action as there will be kind of arbitrage opportunity between those two ways of obtaining MOR depending on the price.

The way I read it, anyone can earn MOR by Providing Compute (out of the 24% emissions bucket). The amount is determined 90% by the bidding process and 10% as a block reward. But to avoid people spinning up thousands of un used nodes for the block reward, only the top 100 Compute Providers (as see in the bidding process) with get the 10% of block reward portion.

What is the problem with thousands of nodes being spin up? I really don‚Äôt see an issue with that. If someone wants to do that, let them.

Also, how is it decided by protocol who ‚Äútop 100 compute providers‚Äù are ? Sounds like this approach is going to lead to a much more centralized distribution of MOR as opposed to the OG model. 

How I see it is, if people want to spin up X amount of nodes, there is zero issue with that. That is how incentives drive scale of compute resources the network has. And this also does not have any downside as far as I can tell.


[1/16/2024 3:57 AM] mahalleinirx
16 gb RAM 16gm VRAM and 4 core should run most smaller-mid models


[1/16/2024 4:03 AM] emersondickie
I understand a response to this was to ‚Äúprevent premature MOR emissions when network doesn‚Äôt need it‚Äù 

Isn‚Äôt the purpose of emissions to have a network with large adaptable scale of compute and because incentives exist, users can access this compute for cheaper than other providers of compute ? The emissions act as payment early on, and help with bootstrapping network. 

I don‚Äôt see how this would be ‚Äúpremature emissions‚Äù considering it is for an intended purpose. The purpose of making it so the network can scale easily and providers of compute can be rewarded in a way where end-users can also access this compute at cheaper than market rates. (Bootstrapping)


[1/16/2024 4:09 AM] mahalleinirx
That problem here is someone with a data centre will spin up 100+ nodes just to get rewards from the bucket but not provide any value to anyone, why should the network give out rewards to people that are not providing the users value? Like paying a service for simply existing


[1/16/2024 4:11 AM] mahalleinirx
It is not about the amount of inferances or nodes a provider provides but the amount of users serviced with a healthy inferance


[1/16/2024 4:12 AM] mahalleinirx
So why reward anyone for spinning up nodes when the compute contracts aren't even running during bootstrapping period? that is why they would be premature emissions


[1/16/2024 4:13 AM] mahalleinirx
Both models require people to have MOR to use the compute, so without the bootstrapping how would people have more to even access the compute


[1/16/2024 4:14 AM] emersondickie
I understand this.


[1/16/2024 4:22 AM] emersondickie

[1/16/2024 4:36 PM] smartagents
Fair point. I personally think the Morpheus community should avoid all central points of failure. Maybe the top 1,000 Compute providers would be better. Maybe there doesn't need to be any limit as long as there isn't a DDOS risk on the Router / Smart Contracts. You should put a Pull Request in on Github if you have a specific proposal.

How is the quality of output by compute providers being rated?


[1/16/2024 4:41 PM] mahalleinirx
Would ask nodes be rewarded here though?


[1/16/2024 4:43 PM] smartagents
No I think this point is about the block reward portion which the Yellowstone paper sets at 10% of the 24% for Compute. But even that is rooted in the bidding system, and comes out of real usage.

[1/16/2024 4:44 PM] smartagents
There is no reward for just running a full node.


[1/16/2024 4:49 PM] erikvoorhees
Long-term, the community should see how usage occurs and how to make things better. 

Short-term, quality of output is simply checked with a pass/fail test of the User who requested it.  By default, everything passes, but user can change to Fail, in which case provider isn't paid.  

Might some Users fail an answer which was actually fine?  Sure, but they have no economic incentive to do so, and so long as it happens only rarely, it won't matter to Providers. (If they lose 1 out of 100 payments due to this, they just charge 1% more in their bid and problem solved).


[1/16/2024 4:51 PM] erikvoorhees
"How I see it is, if people want to spin up X amount of nodes, there is zero issue with that. "

The issue is that there is only so much emissions to pay out. Every MOR sent to idle (unused) compute is essentially wasted... at least highly inefficient. 

Network wants to pay when user gets good inference result from compute provider. 

Network doesn't want to pay when provider just has "capacity" available. If Network paid for unused capacity, we'd get a lot of unused capacity.  Would feel good for the Providers of that capacity! But not good for MOR or rest of network actors.


[1/16/2024 4:54 PM] erikvoorhees
There is no minimum requirement built into the network.  Each compute Provider must simply run at least one (or several) open source LLMs. A Macbook M2 is generally powerful enough to run one of the basic models. 

A compute provider that actually wants to make a commercial business out of this on Morpheus, will care a lot about things like network uptime and reliability, the ability to gracefully fulfill dozens of simultaneous requests from the router, etc.

[1/17/2024 2:48 AM] mahalleinirx
That is what I think  Emerson was trying to say, spin up nodes and they be rewarded, while I think that yellowstone model and what Erik said above makes more sense instead of rewarding people using the old model of just providing inference


[1/17/2024 3:25 AM] mahalleinirx
I think you misunderstand, there are no nodes running during the bootstrapping phase


[1/17/2024 3:31 AM] mahalleinirx
I think the main thing here is why incentivize people for providing no value? the health check operates when I user interacts with the inferance, so while yes there may be a higher capacity you could also get a bunch of garbage nodes and they are being rewarded,


[1/17/2024 3:31 AM] mahalleinirx
I could run a data centre and game it by providing a bunch of useless nodes just to run up my capacity and be rewarded for that


[1/17/2024 3:32 AM] mahalleinirx
while in the case of capital contribution the yield is used to pay for liquidity, which having deep liquidity is very important in the web3 space, and to ultimately pay for transaction fees as well


[1/17/2024 3:36 AM] mahalleinirx
Liquidity has inherent value, as we are trying to run llm's here with Morpheus and not just having the compute being idle oe used for something else  I think it makes sense to reward it in the way Erik has proposed


[1/17/2024 3:36 AM] mahalleinirx
If it was just compute that we wanted then it would make sense


[1/17/2024 3:44 AM] mahalleinirx
I think the MOR rewards are incentive enough for compute providers to come in early, I don't think network underutilization will turn them away as I don't think they will care about the fees and offer it free to begin with


[1/17/2024 3:44 AM] mahalleinirx
Correct


[1/17/2024 3:45 AM] mahalleinirx
So being an early provider is better for people offering compute


[1/17/2024 3:47 AM] mahalleinirx
New model is less about amount being held and more on the health of the inferance and the price of the LT you are offering


[1/17/2024 3:47 AM] mahalleinirx
you just need to be holding MOR tokens to be eligible


[1/17/2024 5:43 AM] 1272
Compute is not storable. Additionally the only risk for compute, is electricity cost, which is only incurred due to a busy network.

I agree idle time is an issue, but it's an issue far beyond the scope of this project.


[1/17/2024 5:44 AM] 1272
AI itself is subject to the same problem. Once models are trained, who will buy all the P100s?


[1/17/2024 6:24 AM] 1272
I can agree with that, although it would depend on how rewards are sent.
It's quite the distribution to calculate, since someone could "run" 100,000 nodes and skew the idle rewards.

At Livepeer we started with an initial onchain router that took price + stake + randomness into account when assigning a provider to a job. It didn't scale, requiring too many on chain txns, but it also suffered from the fact that ultimately users needed to determine QoS from a provider themselves: taking into account proximity TO THE USER, latency and performance requirements TO THE USER based on the job type, etc. For example, mapped to a job type like image generation, a user may be willing to pay less for lazy async image generation for a non-realtime application, but may be willing to pay more for a nearby node to do sub 200-ms image generation. We evolved to users connecting direct to providers and managing their own redundancies, failovers, QoS detection.

The Router seems to be a privileged role, in that it can instruct the compute contract to credit a provider. But it's also stated that the Router never submits blockchain txns. How does The Router pass info to the compute contract?


[1/17/2024 9:00 PM] thedob
‚Äî‚Äî-
Second, I‚Äôm concerned about a centralized router as a viable starting point. If the speculative value of MOR to be gained is greater than the fees to be paid by a user, then it sets up an incentive for ‚Äúself dealing‚Äù fake work through the router to one‚Äôs own provider nodes. A centralized router CAN engage in the arms race of trying to detect and prevent these scenarios, but then you just end up with one router entity/company(?) determining MOR allocation and applying subjective judgement to what is and isn‚Äôt censored on the network. And I don‚Äôt love that starting point. 

I think it‚Äôs worth a basic-but-dectralized router mechanism from the get go. For example a stake based election of N router nodes whose JOB it is to apply this subjectivity in the networks best interest. If the size of N can change over time via governance, and those nodes can be added or removed via stake movements, then at least you‚Äôre starting with a decentralized trust assumption that the network only works if x% of stake is applied in the networks best interest. And there are checks and balances against bad actors who would lose their valuable router role. Routers could receive a fixed % of emissions so they wouldn‚Äôt want to lose that.


[1/17/2024 11:27 PM] smartagents
Great comments. Thanks for all the detailed thoughts. You should connect with @Maxwell_Smart_Agent and others thinking about / working on the open source for the Router.


[1/17/2024 11:28 PM] smartagents
Agreed. That would be great. The current thoughts I've seen are simple but decentralized.


[1/18/2024 2:13 AM] scott_b_
Agreed!  We are finishing up the schematics that illustrate  a variation on the ERC4337 abstract layer. It will serve as part of the node and operate as a relay of inference sessions, then noted on chain. This accounting of inference is them separated from the consumption of inference so that the prompts and responses remain outside the blockchain and private.


[1/18/2024 2:15 AM] scott_b_
The network has no access to the conversation in a way that is still day-1 decentralized. Would love your thoughts.


[1/18/2024 2:18 AM] spiceandrice
hi, completely new here and interested in providing compute - how do we do that / is there a way yet? pls lmk if there's anything i should read to learn more. Just saw the github link to the yellowstone page, looking at that rn


[1/18/2024 2:24 AM] thedob
Cool. So I view the ERC4337 as a sort of rollup architecture, submitting proofs of a series of txns batched together in one periodic transaction. That makes sense. As the network of these relayers grows from 1 to many, you may need larger User deposits, or more rate limiting on the job allocation based on how much MOR they hold, in order to prevent doublespends...though that can probably be solved later.


[1/18/2024 2:27 AM] thedob
Do you have a contemplated solution to this challenge?

* A User continuously requests a provider through the router for a new job, until they get assigned a provider that they are also running
* When a user gets assigned a provider they are not running, they either never send the job, or even worse, they send a job to grief that provider and use their compute, but then never submit the Pass/Fail result proof back to the relayer.
* When they get assigned their own provider, they don't even need to do the inference work...they just report back a pre-compute Pass/fail result based on a known job input and output that was previously calculated.
* Therefore they maximize the MOR rewards allocated to their provider without actually doing work, while griefing other providers who don't receive any benefit?

I can suggest some ideas, but curious if it's already considered in the router or protocol?


[1/18/2024 2:39 AM] scott_b_
There are a few ideas. To some of these  problems, winning bids for inference could spawn a 4337 ‚Äúinference contract‚Äù that holds the  MOR  defined in the bid. Sessions  of successful inference consumption are derived from the relay network and paid out to the provider. Junk sessions could  be patterned and scrutinized prior to payout.  4337 seems to also allow for reserve wallets for when allocated MOR is depleted. In this case I‚Äôm not sure how the auto depleted MOR affects the inference-for-holding timing. Overflow wallets may need to be post bootstrapping or community driven.


[1/18/2024 2:44 AM] scott_b_
But the inference contract seems doable in bootstrapping and can naturally scale to an infinite orbit of contracts an agent can consult smartrank on.


[1/18/2024 2:46 AM] scott_b_
All of that makes sense in my head, but realize a lot of detail isn‚Äôt covered. Anyone want to jump in a room and discuss?


[1/18/2024 2:51 AM] scott_b_
I think the akash.network has a MOR template for providers and their learning curve isn‚Äôt painful.

Yes happy to. MSA and I spoke for awhile today. One followup step was that I was going to try to write out the spec for the protocol between the User, Relayer, Provider in a little more detail than provided in the Yellowstone paper, and also list out the attacks that we need to mitigate. That doc might be a good basis for the wider call.

No. All Compute Providers can receive rewards in the Yellowstone Model.
3,110.4 MOR per day to start, which is 90% (of the 24% emissions for Compute Providers) are rewarded via the bidding system proposed.
There is an open debate on the last 10%. Thought is to use the final 10% via a block reward to boot strap usage. Might be the top 100 or top 1,000 has been proposed. Should be maximally open without allowing DDOS attack.

I tried setting up Morpheus on a bit old linux box. When launching the app, it complained that ollama cant be started. Therefore I had to start the ollama manually and then the app started up fine (after ollama downloaded some files).


[1/22/2024 9:12 PM] sadmouse
Question: is that because of old OS or there are some other issues?


[1/22/2024 9:13 PM] sadmouse
Question 2: How to know that my setup is working fine other than chatting in the app? I mean - how to check if the system performs well, if the GPU is working as it should, how performant the setup is etc.


[1/22/2024 9:14 PM] sadmouse
(by a bit old I mean Linux Mint 20.1 which is based on Ubuntu 20.04. Hardware is AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16c, 32threads), 64GB RAM, RTX 3080.


[1/22/2024 9:16 PM] sadmouse
I guess this in ollama log should tell that GPU is working fine:


[1/22/2024 9:17 PM] sadmouse
ggml_init_cublas: found 1 CUDA devices: Device 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, compute capability 8.6

You can disregard the question about GPU. It looks like its working fine (judging by ollama output).


[1/22/2024 9:31 PM] sadmouse
One more question - how do devices actually get linked/monitored etc.? Usually with the chain software we can see that there are nodes that get connected, some ledger is passed around etc. How does that happen here? All I can visually see right now is just ollama install with GUI on top. How does everything else hook into this? Some wallets, ledger,  other nodes, APIs etc.? Are there any docs on that?

I was going through the paper, but could not figure out what of that is already done, what's planned to be added shortly and what's general timeline for remaining things. Trying to figure out if it's really just GUI + ollama at this moment without anything else on top or I'm missing something.


[1/22/2024 10:28 PM] freeman8008
Oh I see. Yes I think you're right, the GUI is very basic right now. Still needs the web3 connections and ability to provide compute


[1/22/2024 10:29 PM] sadmouse
OK. Then it looks like I'm up to speed with all this. Now just to follow along the changes etc. üôÇ

Is there a guide for how to provide compute?


[1/22/2024 11:05 PM] nickdgarcia
Like after running a node, what is the next step to providing compute?


[1/22/2024 11:50 PM] mahalleinirx
As stated above the compute contracts are not finished yet so can't provide compute yet


[1/22/2024 11:51 PM] mahalleinirx
We're hoping to have that available after the 91 day bootstrapping period :sadgepray:


[1/23/2024 12:08 AM] nickdgarcia
So when mainnet launches, how can we qualify as a "compute provider?


[1/23/2024 12:17 AM] mahalleinirx
You can't, only after mainnet


[1/23/2024 1:02 AM] wolfiecrypto
So can we provide compute during the 90 day bootstrapping period?  Or does that happen after?


[1/23/2024 1:02 AM] freeman8008
after. compute contracts aren't yet complete


[1/23/2024 1:03 AM] wolfiecrypto
oh interesintg.  so during bootstrapping period.  how do we earn MOR?   Is it only through staking ETH?


[1/23/2024 1:04 AM] freeman8008
that's correct


[1/23/2024 1:04 AM] wolfiecrypto
is htere a fixed % yield to the st ETH


[1/23/2024 1:17 AM] mahalleinirx
Pro-rata depending on how much stETH there is


[1/23/2024 1:48 AM] nickdgarcia
So just to be 10000% clear - you can only provide compute AFTER the boostrapping period. During the boostrapping period, the ONLY way to earn MOR is via stETH. Is this correct?

What kind of GPU would be needed to provide compute to MOR?


[1/23/2024 6:33 PM] mahalleinirx
At the moment 16gb nvidia gpu will run a node but hopefully when compute contracts are out ollama will be able to support other GPUs like Intel and AMD


[1/23/2024 8:57 PM] spacemoonz
I have AMD GPUs I can contribute. Let me know whenever there‚Äôs a way pls

does anyone have any experience on price comparison for running inference on a desktop GPU (Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU) vs on Akash


[1/24/2024 11:03 AM] spacemoonz
If you figure out I would love to know as well senpai


[1/24/2024 11:21 AM] zenemperor
yeah I cant really figure this out... For example is an macbook mini M2 pro enough for inference?


[1/24/2024 11:22 AM] spacemoonz
No, you need NVIDIA GPUs


[1/24/2024 11:23 AM] zenemperor
even for inference?


[1/24/2024 11:24 AM] spacemoonz
No idea bro about inference. I‚Äôm a PoW miner but would love to understand this better as well


[1/24/2024 11:25 AM] zenemperor
awesome. Are you mining any PoW tokens rn, if yes, which platform do you use? I am trying to figure out the best machine I can buy for multiple purposes.


[1/24/2024 11:25 AM] spacemoonz
I have mostly SHA256 ASICs and then some GPUs that are left from the ETH mining days


[1/24/2024 11:25 AM] spacemoonz

What are you trying to do? I can guide you in right direction from a mining perspective


[1/24/2024 11:32 AM] zenemperor
I am mainly trying to setup an infrastructure for:
a) Compute for AI- for Morpheus etc.
b) Running a node - for Monad etc. (this i know the config needed)
c) Also mine tokens, like folks mined ZEPH, using either Akash or using a desktop infra.


[1/24/2024 11:33 AM] spacemoonz
For this I highly recommend getting NVIDIA and NVIDIA GPUs only. They will always have a good use case as AI heats up. Having your own GPUs is the only way to get the biggest piece of this pie


[1/24/2024 11:34 AM] spacemoonz
For GPUs, try to buy them new from authorised resellers. Avoid used ones

While this is not fixed there is a workaround. Check the path to ollama, go into terminal and launch it manually. Once it's running, launch GUI and it should be fine.

Can I run a node via a VPs ?


[1/25/2024 9:24 PM] altbabymonk
so compute providers are not launching Feb8 then?


[1/25/2024 9:26 PM] stoked0598
nope but we all can use the bootstrapping phase to build up our node properly


[1/25/2024 9:26 PM] altbabymonk
true, but GPU's are not cheap , so how long will this period be...


[1/25/2024 9:45 PM] freeman8008
Not sure, all we know is sometime after Feb 8


[1/25/2024 9:46 PM] freeman8008
It‚Äôs still being worked on by open source devs


[1/25/2024 9:46 PM] youaintmyfry
So what happens to the emissions for compute providers ?


[1/25/2024 9:47 PM] youaintmyfry
during the start of the bootstrapping period  on the 8th for  capital providers


[1/25/2024 9:51 PM] smartagents
All emissions start at the same time.
So any Compute Provider emissions will sit in the Smart Contract until their distribution can go live after day 91.


[1/25/2024 10:04 PM] youaintmyfry
I see and can I operate a node via a VPS if I meet the compute requirements ?


[1/25/2024 10:32 PM] freeman8008
most likely but can't confirm anything yet until compute functionality is completed


[1/25/2024 10:36 PM] youaintmyfry
when will this be completed


[1/25/2024 10:37 PM] freeman8008
there's no estimate, it's being worked on by open source devs


[1/25/2024 10:40 PM] youaintmyfry
sounds like itll be finalized before the 8th

or during?


[1/25/2024 10:42 PM] freeman8008

[1/25/2024 10:42 PM] freeman8008
keep an eye on announcements for updates


[1/25/2024 10:42 PM] antonb
Boot Strapping Period Phase 2 - Compute & Community

As part of the broader bootstrapping period but may last longer than 90 days for Compute Providers and Community Builders the Smart Contracts will build up MOR tokens rewards from day 1. However the Smart Contracts will not distribute the MOR tokens to Compute Providers and Community Builders until the Compute Router and other details are developed by the community.


[1/25/2024 10:51 PM] youaintmyfry
is there a rough date for when emissions start for compute providers ?

no dates

[1/26/2024 5:12 AM] antonb
There is no newbie guide and many parts are developing. There is also no incentives to run a node if you are not going to provide compute or build apps/interfaces.
The simpliest way to get involved is to be ready for fair launch on Feb 8th.


[1/26/2024 5:13 AM] antonb

[1/26/2024 4:41 PM] antonb
In Morpheus terms, community builder is someone who develops interfaces/apps/tools that users would use.


[1/26/2024 4:42 PM] marsvikings
Ah ok, sorry for the confusion. That's unfortunately not in my ski set.


[1/27/2024 4:37 AM] wolfcube
So running a node is seperate to providing compute ? You need to run a node in order to provide compute ?


[1/27/2024 4:37 AM] wolfcube
Is it an automatic process , like can I run my 4090 server to provide compute automatically through the node ?


[1/27/2024 4:49 AM] mahalleinirx
At the moment compute contracts are not live so you can't actually provide compute, running a local node is a local inference of the LLM launched, when contracts are live you should then be able to interact with the wider Web2 and Web3 space


[1/27/2024 4:51 AM] mahalleinirx
I do not believe it will be automatic, you will have to have MOR in wallet, select inference you wish to provide and bid price etc, I suggest you read the Yellowstone Compute Model paper to understand the process better

[1/28/2024 12:50 AM] glcstaked

the application has a GUI then, no need to setup a system service or something to run this?

Unfortunately no, as compute contracts are being developed at the moment with approx. aim for launch near or after 90 days of bootstrapping period.

@The Oracle could provide more information on progress


[1/29/2024 2:13 AM] mahalleinirx
Contributing devs are doing everything in their power to have compute contracts out after the bootstrapping period but there are no guarantees for that, doing everything in my power to onboard devs

Whenever Compute contracts are live, most likely after 91 days :sadgepray:

kk thx. was confused a bit if there was going to be retroactive rewards for phase 1 but if no compute contracts up on the 8th...no compute to provide

[1/31/2024 3:29 AM] smartagents
That's it for right now. 0.0.6 version will have wallet connections. 0.0.7 will have Smart Contract embeddings.


[1/31/2024 3:30 AM] smartagents
Then as the Compute aspects get developed Compute Providers will use the full now that includes the Decentralized Router.

are there full specs for running the node?


[2/1/2024 9:28 PM] antonb
Ola! They are in #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**How can I run the node? **
You need a Mac or PC with Linux Debian with 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core, this a minimum requirement to ensure that there will be no issue on the system side and run most LLMs, follow steps from the guides located in the readme on Github.


[2/2/2024 8:51 PM] joe_ai
If I've understood correctly: 

1. the compute provider for a given job will be chosen based on which compute provider has staked more MOR.  

2. computer providers are able to set their own fees for selling compute, with the fees priced in MOR. 

If these assumptions are correct, then what happens in a scenario whereby a compute provider has the highest stake, but is charging a higher fee for the job than another compute provider that has staked less? Does the one that has staked the most still get the job?


[2/2/2024 9:01 PM] antonb
Hi JoeyC, I believe that the concept when compute requests are routed to a provider with the biggest MOR holdings has been waived and instead, bidding system through router is introduced.

Sure


[2/5/2024 6:23 PM] joe_ai
Not sure this is gonna work... If I've understood correctly,  the amount of free compute you get is a function of your MOR balance. So if you want more compute than you have, go and HOLD more MOR. 

But this is problematic because MOR token value may not be a good proxy for a competitive price of compute. If providing compute was literally the only utility of MOR, then I could see how this makes sense. But realistically, MOR demand will be driven by speculators as well as other utility from other services that the community might build. 

So if I could buy compute power for say $1 somewhere else, but with MOR I'd have to hold $10 worth in my wallet to access the same amount of compute power, the model for compute provision simply doesn't work. 

What am I missing?


[2/5/2024 6:39 PM] antonb
Hi @JoeyC. How's the weather in Lisbon?

My guess that there will be a way to buy additional compute when your Access Rate is exhausted. 

Also, since the vast majority of end users will not interact with Morpheus directly, but through interfaces, the model of holding tokens and receiving a certain share of the –°ompute looks very lucrative.
An app builder can earn MOR rewards for using their app and thus accumulate stake to gain more and more free Compute every day.


[2/5/2024 6:42 PM] joe_ai
bit overcast today. But it was 23 degrees over the weekend, so for Feb, can't complain üôÇ


[2/5/2024 6:43 PM] antonb
The model assumes that there is no incentive to falsely Fail a provider (no monetary incentive in doing so).


[2/5/2024 6:44 PM] joe_ai
"My guess that there will be a way to buy additional compute when your Access Rate is exhausted. " - would just make these additional options to top up your compute be in MOR. Otherwise, MOR isnt' caputuring max value.

Couple of points here. I think the "Stake MOR for Inference" which I think is a good summary of the Yellowstone model, is a compelling model if you have a recurring need for Inference. If you want a more limited consumption of Inference just buy MOR and use it as fees paid to the Compute Provider.

It's in the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**Do compute providers earn emissions during the bootstrapping period?**
As the compute contracts are not finalized there will be no way to provide compute at this time, however, the compute emissions will still emit into the bucket to which will be used to reward providers once compute provision is possible.

I could run a node with a lot of IPS but I'm just responding with whatever text I want, or a different model than what I say, or a censored model with filters


[2/9/2024 12:07 AM] throughnothing

[2/9/2024 12:19 AM] matt__117
any reason why we wouldn't want people to be able to run a node with rented servers?


[2/9/2024 12:29 AM] throughnothing
all I see in the whitepaper around this is "When a Provider wins the bid, it provides the compute resource (GPUs, etc) for various AI models to the user. Providers should need to prove they have a given LLM, by signing hash of LLM model with their key." Seems like an ok first step, but just because a server has a model available (or *had* the model available, at some time in the past), doesn't mean they are running it for you


[2/9/2024 12:34 AM] antonb
From the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**Can I run the node on VPS?**
You can not run one at the moment as there is no version of the node that can operate without a GUI yet.

Morpheus is built fully in open source manner. I believe that with available dev resources this is not a priority, but surely will be implemented later.


[2/9/2024 12:36 AM] antonb
As I read it, there will be like app store for models and user can choose one that fulfills their needs and Compute Providers who have this model would compete with bids.


[2/9/2024 12:43 AM] throughnothing
yeah that makes sense to me. I think an addition will be needed at some point to "prove" that the result computed by the compute provider is the result of the given model requested. There are already tools and frameworks in place to do this, but of course generating that proof (or computing the model within the context of a proof) is more expensive, so cost to users would go up

Considering upgrading my computer (currently on a 2019 Mac Pro). If I wanted to upgrade it to something powerful enough to run my own LLM models but also offer compute resources to the Morpheus network, what would be your recommendations?  In terms of budget, I wouldn‚Äôt mind investing in the tens of thousands if I thought the return in the form of MOR could be worthwhile.

[2/11/2024 12:23 AM] nobodyelse6997
So, a bit confused:
- Compute has a bootstrapping phase AFTER the first 90 days, correct?
- yet the rewards for compute providers, acc to the github, also accrue from Day 1
- from this chat I take it you cannot provide compute at this time (now)?

So my question: the 3450 or so token daily accruing to compute providers, how will these be allocated during the current, first 90 day phase? The about page says all 1.28m tokens of the first 90 days are claimable day 91. so does that mean that anyone who now runs the software during these first 90 days essentially already accrues token? Or how will this work. Hope I am being clear. Thanks


[2/11/2024 12:26 AM] smartagents
Good questions.
1. Compute has to come after the MOR tokens are sendable / claimable otherwise no way to pay for Inference in the system.
2. The MOR rewards are just sitting in the Smart Contract / Multisig building up for the 90 day period.
3. Compute needs the Decentralized Router to get build first (hopefully in the next 90 days or so).

Okay thanks. So basically the compute rewards will sit at around 400k token and then be a part of the total reward pool shared between compute participants during phase 2?

{Reactions}
sadgepray üëçüèº 

[2/11/2024 12:29 AM] nobodyelse6997
Which also implies that, on day 91, there will not be 1.28m MOR token effectively in circulation, rather it will only be the c 700k or so token attributed to capital and code?


[2/11/2024 12:30 AM] nobodyelse6997
(As the balance is still unclaimable as it has to be allocated in future phases)

I'm intrigued by the challenge of making Morpheus.ai's marketplace as responsive and accessible as possible.

These tasks can become resource-intensive, potentially slowing down agent delivery and marketplace interactions.

[2/13/2024 8:00 PM] notmrhuman
Do you see potential value in developing specialized nodes focused on these pre-processing and optimization tasks?

If there is a smart agent that requires that level of processing, the compute could definitely be used across other TCM projects in the future, the vision would be that all aspects of capital compute etc can be used to bootstrap other TCM projects

Does the project track specific performance metrics on common agent interactions (search speed, execution times)? Where might potential performance bottlenecks occur with larger marketplace adoption?


[2/14/2024 7:58 AM] notmrhuman
and is there interest in community-driven benchmarking tools to compare node performance for specific task types? This could aid new TCMs in assessing hardware adequacy and pinpoint areas for broader optimization.


[2/14/2024 8:24 AM] mahalleinirx
Great questions! To answer:

1) There will be a health check on agents to see if they are operating, as for performance metrics I assume there will be and marketplace dynamics will bring the best performing agents to the top.
2) I see the only performance bottlenecks being if there are some large models that are being used that are popular and not enough compute providers that can provide compute for a model of that size
3) There are currently no nodes running as compute contracts are not live to be able to have benchmarking tools but I believe something that will exist in the future

I agree in that it could help with broader optimization and will have to see how the community rallies to build these kinds of tools

It's for Compute, but again, it's just a high level plan and something can change.
There is no specific that is set in stone yet, but you can be sure that these rewards will ONLY be spent for the purpose they emitted.

Currently Compute and Community emissions simply stored in the distribution contract.

Thank you for the  clarification and link to the Yellowstone Compute Model document. The outlined commitment to incentivize early compute providers is truly encouraging! To facilitate strategic investment and better align my contributions, I have some important follow-up questions regarding token distribution post-mainnet:

**Scaling of Rewards:** Would compute providers with significantly different resource contributions, both starting from Day 1, expect proportionally scaled MOR allocations, or is there a greater emphasis on rewarding the earliest supporters?

**Release Triggers:** Could you outline potential network milestones or events that might trigger the release of stored MOR from the distribution contract? Examples could include achieving a  target number of active nodes, surpassing agent complexity thresholds, or the implementation of crucial governance mechanisms.

**Rewarding Differentiators:**  Will earned MOR accumulation solely depend on  raw computational power, or are there plans to factor in elements such as consistent node uptime, successful service provision for diverse agent models, or active community involvement and governance participation?

**Incentive Structure Understanding:** Recognizing that incentive programs may evolve,  could you shed light on any preliminary targets or performance indicators within the Morpheus system that compute providers should be particularly attentive to for long-term success?

Thank you for taking the time to address these questions and foster thoughtful participation!


[2/15/2024 12:10 PM] antonb
GM I believe that's addressed to me and glad to see you find Yellowstone model encouraging! 
Will go through your good questions below.


[2/15/2024 12:36 PM] antonb
> Scaling of Rewards.
Due to the fact that system rewards compute providers based on demand for their compute and not resource they have, it gives them equal opportunities as long as they provide "fast enough" results. As both of them compete for users' RFCs through bids, there can be numerous strategies in place. For instance, larger provider could be interested in serving more complicated models, when smaller one on simpler and niche.

> Release Triggers:
I'm not aware of such planned in advance events that could lead to MOR release. The release of MOR is strategic in nature, with a planning horizon for decades to come and likely will depend on growing demand and need of additional incentives.

> Rewarding Differentiators: 
It all boils down to a formula:
`Router instructs Compute Contract to credit Provider with MOR if [milliseconds] per [IPS] is no worse than X% below mean of past Z queries for that [LLM] and if User reported [Pass].`

> Incentive Structure Understanding:
The last thing I would like to do is mislead you, so I can‚Äôt answer for sure. But may assume that an ability to compete with other providers in terms of uptime, bandwidth, RFC bids, etc, is the key.

Maybe @SmartAgents or @The Oracle would want to add something.
Thank you for your keen interest!

I'm excited about the idea that rewards  go beyond simple 'who has the biggest machine'. Could you give some examples of  what drives 'demand'  higher? Would an agent that's super complex but runs once give the same reward potential as lots of smaller but frequent tasks?

I like the possibility of smaller compute providers thriving by specializing. If, theoretically, the perfect cheap node for small, common tasks emerges, should the rest of us worry about being driven out of the marketplace? Are there plans to support a healthy mix of  node setups even within that competition?

[2/15/2024 9:04 PM] antonb
> Could you give some examples of  what drives 'demand'  higher?
Demand for compute will come from two sources:
- from MOR holders who get daily IPS pro rata to holdings
- from users (mostly app builders) who buy MOR to pay for compute
Initially, most of the MOR will be unused and sit in wallets and exchanges, and only a fraction will be used to demand the IPS production. But with ecosystem growth, there utilization rate will increase as exchanges and other projects where users would deposit their MOR will get "free" compute and can realize various and increase demand, 
The same applicable to community builders.

> Would an agent that's super complex but runs once give the same reward potential as lots of smaller but frequent tasks?
It's impossible to predict this accurately as this will be a free  supply/demand market of compute.

What would I recommend it's to come back to this question later since the launch roughly is in 3 months and a lot things could change. Closer to day X there is going to be more details and specifics.
But there's one thing you can be sure won't change, and that's fair launch approach, meaning equal opportunities for every participant.

[2/17/2024 4:11 AM] navi_mayne
Hey @antonb | will not DM you thanks for your messages above, I've read a lot of them but wanted to clarify a few things.

1. Sounds like users can provide compute right now but the metrics are stored in a distribution contract. (https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1167520834139738289/1207373910715408444). Correct?

2. Actual tokens won't be available until ~May when Router & Compute contract is live (https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1167520834139738289/1207314408167055400). Once this happens, will users earn tokens for any compute they provide prior to these contracts going live, based on what's in the distribution contract linked in question 1?

3. As a Mac user, if I've downloaded the application and have it running, am I providing compute? Or are Mac users still sidelined from that? 

Thank you!

This is my understanding - Per the Waterloo Community Builder Model, it mentions that even though Community front-end builders only begin earning at Step 4, they will earn from the 'accrued emissions available'

Hi Navi! Thanks for your questions.

1 & 2. Users can't provide Compute until the Compute contract and Router are live at the Phase 2 (~May), but the emissions have started on Feb 8th and currently are accumulating in the distribution contract. The distribution will take place only based on factual Compute provided.

3. Currently node (0.0.5) is the local LLM based on Ollama, it will evolve from release to release to the Node through which you can provide Compute approx in May. 0.0.6 version will have wallet connections. 0.0.7 will have Smart Contract embeddings.

I'm a little confused about the above, it sounded like compute emissions and being accrued already and you will be rewarded later for providing compute now? Or do you mean they are being accrued in the contract and will be distributed for people that provide compute in May?

Is latency the killer criteria or is true decentralisation achievable by having a chance to process also in providing compute with residential connectivity vs datacenter only?

During the mid 2010s, I made a supposition that most unprofitable VC backed companies were spending $.40 of every $1 raised on FB and Google ads and AWS compute. It turned out to be largely right. 

Unfortunately, we are back to this same cycle in AI with NVDA but  I worry that‚Ä¶

Is the aim with Morpheus that a balance is struck where hodlers of MOR have access "free" compute?


[2/21/2024 12:44 AM] salwilliam
If it works like that then access to MOR might give projects in the Morpheus ecosystem a large competitive edge.

I guess holders of MOR would benefit from MOR going up in value as the network grows and the token increases in utility, allowing them access to compute


[2/21/2024 12:55 AM] coinly4306
I'm interested in how MOR will work together with existing compute networks like AKT


[2/21/2024 12:58 AM] coinly4306
Has anyone considered how we will balance demand for compute over time? It will likely fluctuate a lot based on usage.


[2/21/2024 1:19 AM] antonb
There will also be an option to pay for compute if you run out of "free" quota.

hi there, i know I asked before. but I am still not too sure if i would like to upgrade my current desktop I am using to meet the minimum or even better the specs needed to provide computing power.


[2/21/2024 10:35 PM] sneakysquidnoob
because i dont really understand how I can actually provide computing power, and What am I actually doing?


[2/21/2024 10:35 PM] sneakysquidnoob
install a program? run it? what does the program actually do?

Hi. It's totally ok asking. We are 2,5 months away from the launch and as we are approaching the launch there will be more information, including specifications and detailed guidance.


[2/21/2024 10:38 PM] sneakysquidnoob
i would like to actually contribute for once, instead of asking since i am so new... providing hardware is probably the easiest for a newbie like me to help out...


[2/21/2024 10:40 PM] antonb
In simple terms you will need to run a node (program), participate in bids auction (set the lowest price you ready to provide compute for) and if won, you PC processes users' request


[2/21/2024 10:41 PM] sneakysquidnoob
oh....means I actually have to be online to bid in auction?


[2/21/2024 10:42 PM] antonb
Your PC can't process calculations if offline


[2/21/2024 10:42 PM] sneakysquidnoob
as in i just have to keep my pc on correct?


[2/21/2024 10:42 PM] sneakysquidnoob
submit a bid once? and wait for auction to end?


[2/21/2024 10:43 PM] sneakysquidnoob
then if i win that auction, my computer will get to process request based on node program?


[2/21/2024 10:43 PM] sneakysquidnoob
and I earned MOR tokens based on the price I set? or?


[2/21/2024 10:44 PM] antonb
It's not that type of auction you might think of, there can be thousands of them per second, it's just a term to describe the process when system choose the lowest price among bidders.


[2/21/2024 10:47 PM] antonb
It's described on the high level in the Yellowstone and as I mentioned,
we are 2,5 months away from the launch and as we are approaching the date there will be more information, including specifications and detailed guidance. To be in the loop, please check announcements from time to time.

So right now, compute providers are not earning MOR rewards right? Are they just in a pool, but not distributed at the moment? since mining has started across capital, code, compute, community?


[2/23/2024 3:38 AM] antonb
That's correct assumption, but they are (Compute and Community emissions) stored not in the pool, but in the distribution contract.

is there a waiting list for adding nodes? We want to make sure we don't miss an opportunity.


[2/23/2024 7:22 PM] antonb
Hi. Running node itself won't make you eligible for any rewards, but it will come in handy if you are going to provide Compute (live approx in May) or build your own app on top of Morpheus (~July). Additionally, when Smart Agents are fully operational and you want to use one locally, I'll need to run a node.


[2/23/2024 7:23 PM] woodlandsrandy
ahh, so what will we need to do in order to earn rewards. I thought running comute power would have been a no brainer


[2/23/2024 7:26 PM] antonb
There are four categories of contributors: capital, code, compute and community app provides.
There are no specifics on how to provide compute yet as we are ~2,5 months away from the launch and compute contract with router are in active development right now.

There are groups of devs working on specific tasks, some community members decided at some moment to create Morpheus socials and now they administrate them, what goes into compute and other project level changes and decisions are go through Morpheus Request for Comments process at Github. All this is facilitated by Atomic Governance Model.

[2/24/2024 4:50 PM] afropunk
and any timeline for the Compute network active? Thanks


[2/24/2024 4:51 PM] antonb
It depends on type of operations and model, but general recommendation is min 16GB vRAM.
Detailed specifications will be published closer to launch ~ in May.


[2/24/2024 4:52 PM] afropunk
So 4090  at least?


[2/24/2024 4:52 PM] afropunk
will it only support LLM models?


[2/24/2024 4:52 PM] afropunk
or some text to imagine model is ok ?


[2/24/2024 4:57 PM] antonb
We are 2,5 months away from the launch, I don't really wanna provide you with information that could change. At least Compute contract and Router should be developed, run and tested in different conditions in order to have information based on empirical data.


[2/24/2024 4:58 PM] afropunk
so will the model be decentralized? If so, do you need training the big model by yourself? Or use some open source model and make it better?


[2/24/2024 4:59 PM] afropunk
Since most LLM need a huge amount resources to training it and huge amount of data


[2/24/2024 5:00 PM] afropunk
one of the idea for Mor, I think you can build some personal agent based on local data.


[2/24/2024 5:00 PM] afropunk
Will be easier?


[2/24/2024 5:00 PM] antonb
Yes, compute model is going to be decentralized. There are both options, you can use network resources to train models as well as use/improve/fine tune opensource.


[2/24/2024 5:01 PM] antonb
Could you elaborate further your idea?


[2/24/2024 5:02 PM] afropunk
but seems even today, no way to training the large language model in a decentralized way ? Since you need 10K A100 and super fast bandwidth


[2/24/2024 5:03 PM] afropunk
some small models can help user training the personal agent without upload their personal data to OpenAI or Google


[2/24/2024 5:04 PM] afropunk
No one want a personal agent trained by Google or microsoft


[2/24/2024 5:04 PM] afropunk
Since you need upload your personal data.


[2/24/2024 5:05 PM] antonb
I can't really say what's the solution on that point devs have, but if you can compile the questions you have in form of the list, I would love to tag someone with needed info and background to address them. üôÇ


[2/24/2024 5:05 PM] afropunk
Mor has the fair launch concept. If we build it in a right way. It has the potential to become the biggest AI network.


[2/24/2024 5:06 PM] afropunk
thanks


[2/24/2024 5:06 PM] afropunk

[2/24/2024 5:07 PM] antonb
AFAIK, your data is always yours as you run Smart Agent locally. In case you use network compute your data is stored in the decentralized way with Filecoin.


[2/24/2024 5:08 PM] afropunk
So before May, the only way to get Mor is  stake the stETH?


[2/24/2024 5:10 PM] antonb
You can also provide Code to the Morpheus GitHub. This is Phase 1.
Phase 2 is Compute (~May) and Community Frontends is Phase 3 (~July).

Hello everyone, I am a newbie. How can I get points through hardware calculation?


[2/27/2024 12:52 PM] antonb
Hi there. Nice to meet you.
We are ~2,5 months away from the Compute launch and as soon as we are approaching the date, more guidance will be provided.
In general, you will need a powerful GPU (16GB vRAM).


[2/27/2024 7:25 PM] tyghh
If one could provide access to Nvidia A10 GPU's would those be usable by MOR as compute that is provided?


[2/27/2024 7:43 PM] antonb
Sure, A10 is the good one for providing compute üëç


[2/27/2024 7:44 PM] tyghh
awesome...will be joining compute legion then <grin>

Is the compute portion of the protocol intended to periodically train a new base model with more inputs and more accuracy, or is it for running specific models?  Perhaps both?


[2/27/2024 10:11 PM] antonb
Compute in Morpheus is more like market between users and providers. If someone needs compute to train any model, they can get it in as daily quota depending on the MOR holdings or buy directly.


[2/27/2024 10:17 PM] godsflaw
Okay, so it‚Äôs really a market mechanism to match compute providers with model training demand.  I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was going to be a way for us to compete with OpenAI, google, or Microsoft by aggregating GPU power to train larger models.  I suppose this can be used for that, but it could cost tens/hundreds of millions.

Please note that compute is not live yet and specifics will be published closer to May.


[2/28/2024 1:02 AM] nickdgarcia
Thank you. I am familiar with these. 

My questions are 1) what are the specs to provide compute? 2) when can community members begin contributing compute?


[2/28/2024 1:05 AM] antonb
Specs are not defined yet, but 16GB vRAM GPU should work well with the most of small-mid size models.
Compute is going to be launched in Phase 2, approx. in ~May.


[2/28/2024 1:11 AM] nickdgarcia
Would a top end MAC Pro have this level of compute? Or would it require buying more custom hardware?


[2/28/2024 1:15 AM] antonb
I believe that local node  with Smart Agent will work fine on Mac Pro, but can't say if it's enough to compete with other compute providers in serving users' requests. 
This will become clear after router and compute contract testing.

"Router selects Provider that supports the [LLM], prioritized based on lowest Bid per IPS in MOR."

the provider with the cheapest price in MOR has more chance to get chosen by the router ? also i guess that the success metrics will count as a "provider history" and will impact it too if i understood well?


[2/28/2024 2:58 PM] antonb
Yeah, I believe you will be able to provide with such projects as Akash or Bittensor


[2/28/2024 3:02 PM] antonb
That's the correct way of thinking, balance should be found between price and "qualify". Information about the actual implementation of this principle is not live yet.

Compute contract and Router are being developed and going live in Phase 2, tentatively in May.


[2/29/2024 2:05 AM] signalxbt_88608
hi - quick question:

after reading the yellowstone paper, it seems that compute providers will receive compensation based on demand and calculation of compute budget. How does this relate to the 24% emissions allocated to Compute Providers? Is this a ceiling on what the aggregate Compute Providers can receive? and what if there isnt enough demand to translate to 24% of the emissions based on the compute budget?


[2/29/2024 2:06 AM] antonb
Capital providers' rewards are not connected with compute in any way.


[2/29/2024 2:07 AM] antonb
May I know what made you think so?


[2/29/2024 2:11 AM] signalxbt_88608
ah sorry meant compute providers not capital providers


[2/29/2024 2:12 AM] antonb
I reckon that the only actual compute is going to be paid and any unused MOR of 24% emissions will be stored in the contract.


[2/29/2024 2:13 AM] signalxbt_88608
when you say stored in the contract, what will be the use of "stored MOR"?


[2/29/2024 3:09 AM] antonb
They will be spent at the later dates, for instance, when there is massive demand or need in additional incentives for compute providers.


[3/1/2024 5:41 PM] 0xpriest_
gm. any doc on how to run a node for compute?


[3/1/2024 5:43 PM] antonb
You can run node, but currently it's just local LLM that's evolving with each release to full node able to provide compute. 
Compute contract and full node are going to be released approx. in May.

11 claims that the payment is the first blockchain tx required, but 10 must be a blockchain tx no? it states" Router instructs Compute Contract to credit Provider with MOR if job was completed satisfactorily." doesn't that imply a change in state on the contract?


[3/3/2024 12:54 AM] antonb
Hi. Thanks for the question. It implies first tx for the Compute Provider.


[3/3/2024 12:55 AM] antonb
when it claims MOR


[3/3/2024 12:58 AM] hodr5815
doesnt this mean tha theres is still one chain tx per inference? in the background section, " It also requires at least one blockchain transaction per inference, which is probably not scalable even on L2s. Each inference event is extremely low cost, and if a blockchain transaction was required, the economics would be infeasible."


[3/3/2024 1:00 AM] hodr5815
or maybe the router could batch credits?

which led me to beleive 10 was per inference


[3/3/2024 1:03 AM] antonb
The reason it's next to 11 is to make that for the Compute Provider clear


[3/3/2024 1:04 AM] antonb
But good catch, it might worth to rephrase

yeah i dont think 10 actually exists if i unerstandcorrectly


[3/3/2024 1:05 AM] hodr5815
seems like it caches the credits locally and maybe periodically comms with smart contract to settle


[3/3/2024 1:05 AM] hodr5815

[3/4/2024 9:25 AM] lazytitan2033
I went through the threads&yellow paper but still unsure about how compute providers will be rewarded. So providers will be rewarded by the number of tasks completed, which are measured in IPS. Can I simply take it as daily reward= (ips fulfilled)/(daily network ips fulfilled)*daily MOR reward


[3/4/2024 9:26 AM] lazytitan2033
Which in this case will be 3456


[3/4/2024 9:27 AM] lazytitan2033
And for ‚ÄúCompute Budget = 1% of Compute Contract MOR balance‚Äù is compute contract MOR balance the same as the daily reward(3456) or something else calculated dynamically?


[3/4/2024 9:28 AM] lazytitan2033
Because users don‚Äôt really pay per query, since their access is granted through owning MOR


[3/4/2024 9:29 AM] lazytitan2033
Thanks!


[3/4/2024 12:53 PM] lazytitan2033
Also for Llama2, do we know which variant (70B/13B ) will be used?


[3/4/2024 12:53 PM] lazytitan2033
and 8bit or 4bit inference? because that will affect GPU choice due to VRAM requirements


[3/4/2024 12:58 PM] antonb
Hello Titan! 
Yes, compute providers are rewarded for factual work done.
Compute contract balance = MOR accumulated from daily compute emissions strating from Feb 8th (when Morpheus launched) till the moment Compute contract is live + daily emissions after.

does this mean rewards for compute have started and just aren't claimable yet?


[3/4/2024 5:26 PM] antonb
Yes, they accumulate in the distribution contract and will start distributing when Router and Compute contract are operational


[3/4/2024 5:28 PM] glcstaked
thanks, but to be clear, if you provide compute right now (is this even possible) you are accumulating rewards they just are not claimable until the distribution is enabled?


[3/4/2024 5:29 PM] antonb
You can't provide compute rn which means you can't earn rewards.


[3/4/2024 5:33 PM] glcstaked
so what happens to this build up of rewards? are they distributed from when the contract goes live to those providing compute (once live) meaning there will be a massive boost in rewards as its the built up rewards + emissions for the start

or are these rewards going to something else


[3/4/2024 5:34 PM] antonb
These rewards are solely dedicated to compute providers.

[3/4/2024 5:38 PM] glcstaked
but as you said nobody is providing compute right now, is that right?
so nobody is earning these rewards, so what happens to these built up rewards, are they frontloaded to the initial emissions?


[3/4/2024 5:40 PM] glcstaked
I've read this above and it doesn't answer my question on rewards build up


[3/4/2024 5:42 PM] antonb
It's also clearly described in the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs and yellowstone doc.

**How can computer providers earn MOR during the bootstrap period when compute contract isn‚Äôt live?**
They can‚Äôt, until Compute Contracts are up and running which will hopefully be soon after bootstrapping.

**What will happen with accumulated and unused MOR Compute emissions?**
MOR emissions intended for Compute Providers will be stored in the reward distribution contract.


[3/4/2024 5:44 PM] antonb
In other words, the emission continues to accrue and is stored in the distribution contract until the compute contract is live = users are able to provide compute and be rewarded (can claim) with MOR tokens


[3/4/2024 5:47 PM] glcstaked
alright, thanks for clarifying, im thinking about this wrong then, basically the rewards just stay there 
so when emissions stop (According to the contract) then there will still be a period where rewards can be earned because of the delay


[3/4/2024 5:55 PM] antonb
Emissions will not stop, they are like bitcoin mining rewards, here for a long long time. üôÇ 
Now they accumulate in the distribution contract, but when compute contract is live it will start receiving emissions as well as get the amount that's been accumulated.
Don't hesitate to ask more, I believe it's important to make it understandable for everyone.

Hello! I am reviewing the Yellowstone white paper (https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md) and I have some doubts with some comments:

**- How does the protocol prevent sybil attacks from a Provider registering large amounts of unexisting/fake nodes? According to the paper `Providers must have non-zero balance to discourage Sybil attack from Provider side.`  Is there a definition on how many MOR is needed for registering a Provider node?**

I don't like the idea of the Provider needing MOR in order to participate in the network. One of the most beautiful things of the protocol is that each of the four pilars (community, compute, code, capital) remain independent to each other. Each one provides something unique and gets rewarded: community brings people, compute brings hardware, code brings buidl, capital brings money. If the compute also has to bring capital (in the form of MOR) I feel that, somehow, it violates this beautiful uniqueness.

**- How does a Provider demonstrates to the network the amount of IPS that it can process?**
**- Which mechanism has the Router to elect the correct Provider?**
**- Who is meant to run the router? **

If there is only one in the network, it represents a single point of failure which is a big risk. If it is distributed and/or decentralized, there should be incentives or rewards for runing it.

----

The amount of work put in Morpheus is amazing, the way is long, but the snowball has strated to roll.
I would love to bring fresh new ideas to the protocol. :Heart:

That are really good questions. 
You should get a DM from one of the contributors to be added to the compute working group.

Hi i'm just a fellow newb like yourself but i think i can answer  this question.

1. Which mechanism has the Router to elect the correct Provider?
   AFAIU, the router effectively creates a free market to match providers users (see https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md#workflow step 3 & 4

    so users from  most to least  MOR balance will get matched with provider asking lowest to highest bid per IPS

Welcome to Morpheus. There are no restrictions for running a node.
I'd suggest to start with #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs first to get a sense of Morpheus and answers for your questions above and if anything is still unclear, don't hesitate to ask üôÇ

Hi! Am I correct in understanding that at launch in May the compute provider set will be whitelist only?


[3/25/2024 11:27 PM] smartagents
That's what @Ryan Condron indicated in his talk. Question is what is the metric for the list? Is it the Compute Provider holding a certain number of MOR to show they economically aligned with the Morpheus protocol's intended functions. I don't see another open and fair way of accomplishing that. Then it becomes a questions of how much MOR indicates a Compute Provider is an honest actor. If there are not many attack vectors that would make the Compute Provider money then the answer might be a fairly small number of MOR would do the job.


[3/25/2024 11:29 PM] antonb
Unstable internet connection, answered right after your question, but message didn't send. 

The way understan Ryan it's just a measure to prevent malicious behaviour and potential attacks while the system matures. This type of whitelist where everyone who follows certain criteria could be added.

same, I have a couple of 4090s
NIM is optimised for 4090s, AIUS is optimised for A100s, most of what I have seen is A100s and the difference is staggering, as in if you try to mine AIUS with a 4090 you have no chance vs A100s

but the opposite was true for NIM, which was surprising, and its good to see something that utilizes 4090s more 

so, i am curious  where MOR will fall into this when it comes to compute provision

[3/29/2024 12:59 AM] glcstaked
you can look at demand for GPU by type 
io.net: 4090's at 0% capacity, A100s, A6000s always in use (20%-94%)
Nosana: A6000 + A4000 has all the job demand, the rest is pratically 0%

Hi! 

Marlin (https://marlin.org) is interested in providing backend infrastructure for Morpheus by leveraging Oyster's TEE-based decentralized operator network (https://marlin.org/oyster). 

We've made some initial progress by creating a modified Morpheus lite client with Ollama running within an Oyster enclave. The setup guide for this configuration is available on GitHub: https://github.com/marlinprotocol/morpheus-oyster-lite-client

How can we run Marlin nodes for Morpheus (we can potentially also contribute towards the dev of it)? Thanks!

Hello @Compute providers!
If you have not yet watched the presentation of the design and architecture of the Morpheus compute node by @Ryan Condron at the Decentralized AI Day, here is the write up with everything you should be aware of as we are rapidly approaching Compute phase launch!

Thanks for sharing the document on the architecture of the Morpheus compute Node.

Would it be possible to get a detailed explanation of how the sessions are established between the user and the inference/compute provider? And how does an inference provider integrate with the existing router/contracts to start providing the compute?


[4/1/2024 3:39 PM] antonb
These are good questions.
I'll tag @Ryan Condron so he can explain it when online!

The providers will need to submit a stake to be added to the onchain registry.... the registry will act as the Morpheus dns system

Thank you for the explanation regarding user-provider communication.

Could you please share any documentation for adding providers to the on-chain registry?

Is there any more information on how much MOR will be required to stake to become a day 1 provider or be on the whitelist?


[4/3/2024 2:23 AM] antonb
Not yet, but I'd say it won't be expensive as the goal is to keep entry barrier low.


[4/3/2024 2:25 AM] 0xjones
Is there any more information on being an early provider in general? I have read through as much material as I can, although trying to plan and prep to start providing on day 1. I understand how the network works, although mainly feel like I am lacking information on how to start or get ready.


[4/3/2024 2:29 AM] antonb
Thanks for asking, I think that is among top questions.
@Ryan Condron Could you please advise when we can have a brief guide or checklist of requirements/recommendations for Compute providers to start on Day 1?

What is called bootstrapping period in the Yellowstone model is likely additional incentives for TOP100 compute providers for the first year.


[4/4/2024 1:49 PM] antonb
Pinned a message.


[4/5/2024 7:29 AM] dodo8244
ah ok so these are incentives on top of existing 24% incentives


[4/5/2024 12:19 PM] antonb
Yes, which will be taken from the rewards accumulated during the bootstrapping period.

hey hey!


[1/2/2024 3:22 AM] asheoro
thx to @The Oracle for creating this channel. It spawned from a convo in telegram about how supply and demand pricing should/could work for various models availalbe and the resource demands for each.


[1/2/2024 3:25 AM] asheoro
my current confusion is around how the price is set for a model. 

1. What happens if a compute-provider who has the most MOR staked is current at resource capacity without an ability for JIT (just-in-time) scaling? This provider should not be prioritized if the model is being served elsewhere. How can this be measured?


[1/2/2024 3:26 AM] asheoro
2. How should the price be set for an in-demand model where supply > demand? The market price should signal this supply/demand mismatch and signal to compute-providers the opportunity.


[1/2/2024 3:26 AM] asheoro
3. What role do captial providers play in the supply/demand dynamic for compute? Are they part of the equation at all or a 3rd party looking in from the outside?


[1/2/2024 3:27 AM] asheoro
ping @Erik Voorhees since this is right up ur area of thinking


[1/2/2024 3:48 AM] mahalleinirx
I believe this is an offchute of the tokenmoics and something that can discussed in finer details here

Mid to late Jan it's an estimate for SCs deploy, right? But the token itself will start circulating after 90 days of bootstrapping period. Correct if I'm wrong.

Rewards only for when stETH is on main net.

alright, thanks. im having a bit of a problem understanding, will there be a fair launch and than 90 days period for bootstraping liquidity, or is it the other way around?


[1/12/2024 10:28 PM] smartagents
Fair launch. Everyone can provide Capital (stETH yield) or Code or Compute or Community (front ends). All on mainnet. But the MOR tokens can only be sent / claimed after 90 days to avoid the issue of not enough tokens for the system to function (that the boot strapping period).

There are accurate figures, no need to guess. Rewards start with 3,456 MOR a day proportionally divided between stETH providers.

Hi Nouhaila. Morpheus has no team, it's open source community owned project. Protocol owned liquidity will sit in Uniswap Arbitrum and if any CEX willing to list MOR they are free to go with it. No permission from anyone needed.

It's stETH on ETH mainnet

Ah ok, so stake on ethereum and then will receive MOR on Arbitrum. Thanks

Hello when will we be able to get some tokens? I‚Äôm not tech savy so hoping I can just buy some


[12/14/2023 11:22 AM] smartagents
The paper talks about a 90 day boot strapping period so people should be able to swap stETH for MOR 90 days after the main net goes live.


[12/14/2023 11:22 AM] smartagents
@robertsutcliffe


[12/15/2023 10:15 AM] robertsutcliffe
Thanks so we have to wait 90 days or we can put the eth and then after 90 days swap it?


[12/15/2023 10:17 AM] smartagents
The Smart Contracts allow people to contribute stETH when it hits mainnet. Post testing.
Only the yield from the stETH is contributed and starts earning MOR. The MOR are then only sendable after 90 days to avoid the Zcash problem where price discovery was impossible early on due to not enough units in circulation at the beginning.


[12/15/2023 10:17 AM] smartagents
@robertsutcliffe


[12/16/2023 2:56 AM] robertsutcliffe
Thank you. Will there be a max on what we can put for Steth?


[12/16/2023 2:57 AM] robertsutcliffe
When does Main net go live? Is there anything I should be doing to be ready? If I want to be a capital contributor


[12/16/2023 3:08 AM] smartagents
I don't think there is any max. Again it will only contribute the yield portion from the re-base. 
No magic date on mainnet. Figure testing period is at least 30 days. Also need a front end for the smart contracts to open it up to more people. There is no formal team or comapny, so just open source developers all collaborting.

[12/19/2023 1:00 AM] jaymoney
so to confirm, right now the only way to get mainnet MOR is via  coding contributions?


[12/19/2023 1:00 AM] jaymoney
are capital/compute paths not active?


[12/19/2023 1:08 AM] smartagents
Good questions.
1. There are NO MOR tokens on mainnet yet. 
2. Code contributors are recording hours, but none of that will be included in rewards until the mainnet launch.
3. The testnet is live now for stETH contributors. Needs a lot of testing / audits and so forth. 
4. There are proposals for how to do the compute provider / community builder inference supply and demand. Still in development.

[12/19/2023 1:09 AM] jaymoney
Ahh I see - I can maybe look through a bit for some contract security stuff; but I'm guessing rn no way to start accumulating mainnet MOR? (in advance I guess)


[12/19/2023 1:11 AM] smartagents
Correct. There is no pre-mine. No company. No foundation. No pre-sale. 
All fair launch, where everyone has to add value to Code, Capital, Community or Compute paths.


[12/19/2023 1:11 AM] jaymoney
Hey nice I like that. Is there a timeline I can reference? Or still working it out?

[12/19/2023 1:15 AM] smartagents
Given no formal team, there is no magic dates. It takes what ever time it takes for the open source coders to bring together the parts of the Morpheus Smart Contracts and Node software. You are more then welcome to help out in the testing. Here is the guide link.

More eyes on the Smart Contracts the better. Likely will be a second set of tests.

The current version is just the MOR minint via stETH on Ethereum. Next need the testing of the Arbitrum bridge / AMM pools on a testnet.

Hi Jadd, can you please try staking an amount, lets say 1% smaller than the amount you approved? I think for some reason in the contract you can't stake the exact amount you approved. I have run into that problem too I think.


[12/22/2023 11:51 PM] jabo38.
Looking at the numbers, it seems like you have approved 0.0009 stETH for staking but tried to stake 50 stETH. Right now it is difficult to write the numbers in WEI instead of ETH but I have been using https://eth-converter.com/ to help me convert.

The approval tx worked, but it means you can stake less than that. You could maybe try staking on 800000000000000 WEI (0.0008 stETH).  I am not sure what the min amount to stake or not is actually though. Or you could try to do another approval for a higher amount and then stake a higher amount.

Trying to install on a windows linux but says I get an error related to D-Bus and X server. It says these errors pertain to graphical environments. Any suggestions?


[12/23/2023 12:22 PM] jaadd
I believe its probably the amount is too low but unfortunately there is not much stETH. Oh well I wait. Thank you for your help

This will be possible at some stage but currently you need a display to access the node and run the inferrance, we will update in the annoucements when this will be possible

There has been an issue in the past with goerli test net and whales attacking the faucet and then selling the test tokens to devs, a similar thing could be happening here, I'll have a look into it too

Yeah people were having to pay for a goerli token that was used to convert to test eth, it was really hindering the devs developing on the network, predatory behaviour


[1/8/2024 11:40 AM] smartagents
@Helios if you are up for continuing to run a Morpheus community testing faucet could you buy up a bunch of Sepolia test tokens people need and hand them out here liberally : )
We would consider you even cooler and more awesome.

{Reactions}
sadgepray (2) 

[1/8/2024 1:38 PM] chimp_
so.

a) the faucet is not under attack. i got .5eth pretty easy. we dont need to buy sepolia eth just yet.
b)stETH is the issue here, not sepolia eth, just to clarify.
c) @antonb | will not DM you i just minted 400,000,000 stETH with 0.4 sepolia test eth. im doing this all on mobile rn but just glancing i think its due to the stETH mock contract being messed up, specifically ``totalPooledEther``. and how that scales down the transfer. just add abunch of zeroes to the wei value when you mint until something works.

{Reactions}
sadgepray 

[1/8/2024 1:40 PM] chimp_
``balanceOf`` function overridden. as it scales the balance by ``totalPooledEther / PRECISION``.


[1/8/2024 6:43 PM] antonb
So the contract owner needs to change totalPooledEther param, right?


[1/8/2024 6:45 PM] antonb
Adding a bunch of zeros is a way, but it will just raise a confusion among users going to test contracts

Hey, all. I'm trying to stake in the distributor contract but getting what I assume is a gas error requesting .9+ SepETH despite correctly following the guide to the best of my knowledge.


[1/9/2024 6:19 PM] cryptocurrantcy
I unfortunately only have .49~ SepETH so in the event gas is simply more expensive, I'm in need of more SepETH.


[1/9/2024 6:19 PM] cryptocurrantcy
Though again, I suspect gas is being inaccurately quoted on account of a contract error (most likely I've mucked something up). Any assistance appreciated.


[1/9/2024 6:21 PM] cryptocurrantcy
Not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but it appears someone staked a gazillion stETH:

This usually happens when you are trying to stake more than approved


[1/9/2024 11:14 PM] borminser
staking still not working as I suppose @chimp is right, its due to the stETH mock contract being messed up, specifically totalPooledEther. and how that scales down the transfer. just add abunch of zeroes to the wei value when you mint until something works. balanceOf function overridden. as it scales the balance by totalPooledEther, can devs do something?

Note from the Smart Contract devs on testnet.

"Users have minted an insane amount of tokens, to be more precise 100000000000100000000000100400010112217285452.66 stETH. while the total amount of real stETH is 9293374.39. Because of this, mathematical operations of multiplication do not work correctly, as the limit on the maximum allowed number is reached.

We thought about it and decided that it is better to redeploy the distribution contract and test stETH with restrictions on token minting. I think we will do it tomorrow."

@Helios Hello
The Smart Contract devs have set a limit of 10 stETH tokens that a user can mint at a time. 
To avoid the problems that occurred last time. 
So the solution is to enter a value not exceeding 10000000000000000000 in the amount field.

[1/21/2024 4:07 AM] antonb
Can't say, but latency is kind of critical since receiving a reward depends on its value.
If you had a chance to have a look at the Yellowstone compute model, there is a clause in the workflow:
> Router instructs Compute Contract to credit Provider with MOR if [milliseconds] per [Token] is no worse than X% below mean of past Z queries for that [LLM] and if User reported [Pass].

Gm tech team. I was just testing the SCs on Sepolia and had a question: 
I was able to deposit stETH and then claim my rewards shortly after (TX https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x60329da33b69d70bc91cc33165bfcd65e07841bd4bbfbd5fdccb41e71c771e49) but do not have any MOR in my wallet. I assume that is because you can't claim your rewards until the lock period is over, but then shouldn't the claim process throw up an error?

I did indeed. Ahhhh, so MOR is issued on ARB Sepolia, when claimed on ETH Sepolia?


[1/25/2024 10:23 PM] antonb
You stake on ETH and claim on ARB. This setup was chosen due to low fees.

Fully agree, from the other side your connection has to be fast enough to satisfy user needs without delays.

The tutorial states it is address '0xe6d01d086a844a61641c75f1bca572e7aa70e154' but that isn't working for me.

It's Arbitrum Sepolia address

I'm not sure if MOR minted on Ethereum Sepolia before being bridged


[2/1/2024 1:03 AM] jabo38.
I guess what I'm wondering is, now that I have claimed MOR following the tutorial, how can I see the MOR balance in Metamask, or at least in an explorer.

You need to switch to Arbitrum Sepolia and import MOR address

I get it. You have a dev shop and want clients. If you want to offer pull requests you can earn hours toward MOR rewards like everyone else : ) Then welcome friend. If you want a centralized company to get paid from then this might not be the fit for you. The key is to find a bug or write some code. Its not the amount of work, but the value of the output that mattters.

I'd just like to confirm does staking include some form of logic which can't be covered with SNX staking or in general inheritance from SNX staking contract? Obv. safety guarantees fall away when inheriting, but at least keeping to the principle makes the code much more auditable


[2/8/2024 8:14 AM] jabo38.
I'm not tech support üôÇ but just curious about this question. SNX is mainly for getting loans, right?  

I think Morpheus is basically implementing a different concept. A user deposits stETH and then gets daily MOR rewards. When the person wants to withdrawal the stETH, they can at anytime. So there really isn't any synthetic asset or market or oravcle needed.

No, lmfao, SNX did a staking contract implementation that has been used since 2019 for distributing linear rewards for any type.


[2/8/2024 7:07 PM] Deleted User
It has a whole article backing it's correctness and is foolproof.


[2/8/2024 7:08 PM] Deleted User
So wherever the logic fits within the bounds of this contract, or close to it, the exact implementation or at least functions implementations should be inherited.

If it's too much for you, maybe it worth considering to deposit when they are usually low?

You could also send a tx with acceptable fee and wait when it is accepted.

Not the surprise as you didn't deposit it.
You are only approved amount, now you need another tx that will send ETH from your wallet to the contract.

I know.


[2/9/2024 1:58 PM] antonb
Just make sure you are on the right chain, click on `"Connect to Web3"` and sign msg


[2/9/2024 1:58 PM] momos6210
I can connect it when I'm in the stEth contact


[2/9/2024 1:58 PM] momos6210
But not when I'm in the distribution contract


[2/9/2024 1:59 PM] antonb
Do you have an error message or what happens when you click it?


[2/9/2024 1:59 PM] momos6210
Nothing happens.


[2/9/2024 1:59 PM] momos6210
My wallet opens and that is it


[2/9/2024 1:59 PM] antonb
Ok. Do you use Metamask?


[2/9/2024 1:59 PM] momos6210
Yes


[2/9/2024 2:00 PM] antonb
Open MM, on the top right you'll see a globe icon, click it and make sure your current wallet connected to the website


[2/9/2024 2:01 PM] momos6210
I've done that first spend 6 times and spent the gas fee 6 times


[2/9/2024 2:01 PM] momos6210
Okay


[2/9/2024 2:02 PM] antonb
Can I know why don't you use website interface?


[2/9/2024 2:07 PM] momos6210
Because I first used the dashboard, but it kept asking me to approve, I approve, spend the gas, and it would ask me to approve again.


[2/9/2024 2:07 PM] momos6210
On etherscan it shows "success"


[2/9/2024 2:08 PM] momos6210
Did it 5 times then I have up on the dashboard


[2/9/2024 2:08 PM] antonb
Weird. Drop me your wallet address, I'd investigate your case

[2/9/2024 2:14 PM] antonb
I believe that you certainly have sufficient approval amount.
So when you try to Stake via the website, it asks you to appove again, right?
If so, could you try to stake not MAX but decrease amount a little? Would it go through or ask for approval again?


[2/9/2024 2:16 PM] momos6210
Yes it does. How much should I decrease it by?


[2/9/2024 2:17 PM] antonb
Let's try 3.018


[2/9/2024 2:22 PM] momos6210
Looks like it worked


[2/9/2024 2:23 PM] momos6210

It's mostly Metamsk issue due to incorrect calculations

You only gave approval to spend stETH, funds still in your wallet.
You need to call another tx, that will deposit funds into the contract. 
Just click Deposit stETH again.

[2/11/2024 12:01 AM] illupoli

[2/11/2024 12:02 AM] antonb
It's because of conflict with other installed wallets. Just disable them for some time

[2/11/2024 12:11 AM] antonb
Morpheus is chain agnostic, when stETH deposits are on Ethereum mainnet, MOR tiken and liquidity are on Arbitrum, low fees wise, which is essential.


[2/11/2024 12:12 AM] illupoli
but MOR token will mainly be traded on arbitrum?

But all very small amounts


[2/11/2024 12:47 AM] antonb
All three are approval, now you need to send stETH to the contract, but no more than you approved, either it will prompt you to approve again

Exactly. Lets say, you want to deposit 1ETH, that means your need to aprove that amount (or more)


[2/11/2024 12:49 AM] josi0002
How do I deposit the stETH now?


[2/11/2024 12:50 AM] antonb
You can send 0.012 now as this is the amount you approved,


[2/11/2024 12:51 AM] josi0002
How do I send it? Under deposit stETH then approve again?


[2/11/2024 12:51 AM] antonb
Yes, click deposit and approve the amount you want to send


[2/11/2024 12:52 AM] antonb
After that click again (when first tx confirmed), second tx will deposit your funds


[2/11/2024 12:53 AM] antonb
You approved again 0.004 ETH


[2/11/2024 12:53 AM] antonb

Many crypto native people use debank to track their portfolio holdings, so when there‚Äôs a new protocol you have to suggest & upvote so debank devs add it.

Proposal says it has been done but I‚Äôm not being able to see my money deposited on Morpheus in my debank portfolio idk why

Getting a similar ‚Äòfailed to start Ollama [‚Ä¶]‚Äù message staring Morpheus as what‚Äôs been reported earlier this month:

You trying the new 0.0.6 code or the older 0.0.5 code version?


[2/11/2024 3:39 AM] ndscrypt
older code version.


[2/11/2024 3:39 AM] smartagents
If you can try 0.0.6 it seems to have fixed a lot of the old Ollama bugs.

Hopefully next week.


[2/11/2024 3:44 AM] ndscrypt
To be clear though, 0.0.6 isn't released ?


[2/11/2024 3:54 AM] smartagents
Its released on the Github for testing. There hasn't been an announcement because most people want to test at the step where its in an easy Mac or Linux install package.

@The Oracle Any thoughts what could be the problem?


[2/11/2024 4:09 AM] lukestokes
I see there was another transaction being executed within 30 seconds, but I'd be surprised if that caused an issue... maybe some kind of race condition?


[2/11/2024 4:10 AM] antonb
Yeah, my guess also, as this is the only thing that looks unusual


[2/11/2024 4:10 AM] lukestokes
you know, that might actually be it


[2/11/2024 4:11 AM] lukestokes
I'm scrolling through previous transaction errors on etherscan and they all seem to be within the same minute of another transaction that went through. interesting.

I guess I'll go ahead and try again


[2/11/2024 4:12 AM] antonb
Seems that contract logic works fine as someone has already staked after you


[2/11/2024 4:12 AM] lukestokes

Do not look at the analytics page of your wallet on etherscan :rage_incarnate_wojak:


[2/11/2024 5:09 AM] mahalleinirx
I had a similar issue when I first deposited, it is either gas price change or transaction at similar time from what my analysis found


[2/11/2024 5:54 AM] cryptamuraicountycap
I fixed it by only using 3 decimals‚Ä¶
I.e. when trying to deposit 10.0383939302 tx failed 2 times.. so I only deposited 10.038 and tx went through no problem


[2/11/2024 5:56 AM] mahalleinirx

were you trying to stake it for stETH or deposit stETH you already had into the contract?

the Transaction was approved not staked you should just have to click the deposit stETH and it should work

You got the stETH. You have to use the Dashboard twice.

2. To stake the stETH

@kdawarrior If you can't see you balance on the dashboard right after tx confirmed, likely you confirmed only one (approval) transaction and need to initiate another one to deposit funds.

From the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 

**Is running a node mandatory?**
A regular user will be able to use Morpheus without running a node and while running the node isn‚Äôt a strict requirement for Capital and Code providers, you won‚Äôt be able to provide Compute and Community services without one.

**Are there rewards for running the Morpheus node?**
There is no reward for running a Local inference at the moment, however, a full node will be rewarded when providing Morpheus Compute and Community functions.

Sorry I don't have any more ideas for how to get it to work for you

You have only approval tx, need to initiate second, that will send funds to the contract

this one

It looks like you (or someone) sent 2stETH to this address 0x0b8804e82fbe6e6ef016b3877cb23da27df3b70 before you approved amount on the Morheus website.
On the screenshot you can see that you stETH leaved your wallet 25 min ago, and Morpheus approval tx is 23 min ago.

If it wasn't you, then someone has a private key to your account as this was simple "transfer" transaction and not smart contract drainer.

They are not as critical, as most of them are related to test version of the contract that was in the repo while testing, so it didn't take much time to fix.

You also need to refresh after approving, at least I did. You've already approved the token 3 times, refresh and you should see the option to deposit.

Surely you've refreshed already after signing the approval, but you just keep approving the contract to stake stETH.


[2/14/2024 9:51 PM] antonb
May I know what browser do you use, as in my case, button switched from approval to deposit automatically, just after approval went through

Did I get you correct that you want to stake ETH to stETH via Lido on Ethereum mainnet?


[2/16/2024 6:26 PM] _gravityforce
Hi, I have a problem to wrap stETH. I'm using Metamask on ETH mainnet. Lido website, and it automatically swap to wstETH. Any help?


[2/16/2024 6:27 PM] antonb
You don't need to wrap it, you just need stETH.


[2/16/2024 6:27 PM] antonb
May I have your address to investigate?

Do you use STAKE function?


[2/16/2024 6:28 PM] _gravityforce
no, wrap


[2/16/2024 6:29 PM] antonb
Please use Stake. it's quite simple process, you deposit ETH and got stETH in exchange.


[2/16/2024 6:29 PM] antonb
Let me know if it worked for you.


[2/16/2024 6:29 PM] _gravityforce
thnaks, that ETH chain is such a crap. and expensive. anyway. thanks for your assisstance


[2/16/2024 6:31 PM] antonb
I feel you, Eth fees sometimes are terrible.
FYI. Wrap is useful feature as converts your stETH to wstETH and allows you to bridge it to L2 chains.


[2/16/2024 6:31 PM] antonb
But in case of Morpheus only stETH is accepted by the contract.

works. one more question. How is the MOR calculated? The snap on minnent is every hour, day? or afer such a period like 90 days?


[2/16/2024 6:37 PM] _gravityforce
and how is MOR reward calculated? in % wise?


[2/16/2024 6:40 PM] antonb
It's different for each category of contributors, but I can assume you are asking about Capital Providers.
It calculates every block based on users' share against total pool of deposited stETH.
Here is the calculator you can play with different scenarious https://morstats.info/staked_eth/

[2/17/2024 3:35 AM] vicevinnybeats
Yes i have clicked on max before


[2/17/2024 3:37 AM] antonb
That was the approval tx, which is part of the deposit process, so you in fact said: "Hey stETH you can send this amount to Morpheus contract". 
Next step is to send the amount you approved.


[2/17/2024 3:38 AM] antonb
If you can send me a screenshot before signing the tx I can try to verify if everything is good


[2/17/2024 3:39 AM] antonb
To manage your expectations, the average $ equivalent in fees is 60 - 100$ depending on the gas cost

There will be essentially two ways to use Smart Agents functionality:
- local install
- using compute of the Morpheus netwok


[2/19/2024 6:05 PM] martincek_gg
So running the "node" means that I'm providing computing power for the community as well as for my needs?


[2/19/2024 6:08 PM] antonb
I'd say you CAN provide compute to the network and use compute for your own needs at the same time, but it would be challenging with only 16gb vRAM


[2/19/2024 6:09 PM] martincek_gg
MOR token will be used to pay for smart agents service?

I think it has most of the answers to the questions you might have.


[2/19/2024 6:17 PM] antonb
The role of the MOR token is a means of value exchange among ecosystem parties.
Every MOR holder will have access to "free" daily compute, proportionally to Its holdings share.

[2/19/2024 9:56 PM] martincek_gg
The future versions of the node may or may not need GPU but should be made such that they don't need GUI, so you can deploy them somewhere easily. Do I understand it correctly?


[2/19/2024 9:56 PM] antonb
Node itself won't earn MOR, you need to provide compute to be rewarded.

Thank you. If you would be so kind and know the answer to second question - is the idea for future such that I will be able to run full node on some dedicated machine without GUI? Will the machine still need GPU with substantial RAM?

A "headless" (no GUI) version of the Morpheus node will definitely be developed. Many devs are looking at this. 
However most of the RAM requirement does not come from the GUI, it comes from the fact that a Large Language Model runs in the RAM of a computer. So for example if its a 7 Billion parameter model (it takes 2 bytes of RAM per parameter) that would be that 14 gigs (14 billion bytes) of RAM to run that 7 Billion parameter model.

The good news is that rewards accrue to your account, so there issue might be with browser or wallet.

Both of your txs are approval. You need to initiate another one that will eventually deposit your stETH into the contract.

150+ contributors to open source code and 3200+ capital providers. Morpheus is solely community driven and owned.

There are only approval txs, now you need to initiate deposit tx.
Please click **Deposit stETH**, enter the amount you want to deposit and click **Stake ** (not Approve)

I'll try it

When sign the tx in the MM, check the type of the tx, it must be "Stake"

[2/22/2024 6:24 PM] victortincky
What's the average?


[2/22/2024 6:24 PM] antonb
This is because approval tx takes less gas. It might be a good idea to wait for acceptable gas price for you.

If I want to deposit a bigger amount of steth, what should I do?

If the amount you want to deposit exceeds the amount you approved before, you'll need to send new approval tx with updated amount and deposit after.

You can talk to your model. In the next 0.0.6 release you will be able to connect metamask and perform some simple actions like initiate tx or check your balance with text prompt


[2/23/2024 1:17 AM] xh90
i see. so currently not a rewarded full node ?

And won't be without providing Compute or using it for connection with your AI app that built on top of Morpheus.

what's the minimum hardware requirements to do Compute ? and is there a stake requirements ?

No stake, but you need to have some balance. Hardware requirements haven't been fully determined yet as we are 2,5 months from launch.

Ok. I‚Äôll do it now on my iPad mini


[2/23/2024 11:28 PM] nino07mv
It worked I am able to see  my Morpheus account info now. Thank you so much.
What was the underlying issue?


[2/23/2024 11:30 PM] antonb
Happy that it finally solved! Likely something with Metamask browser, devs will look if something can be done from the Morpheus side.

Have you signed a drainer contract for your wallet with stETH or they have your seed phrase?


[2/24/2024 12:17 PM] murch4459
I'm not sure. They drained my DIMO and USDT.


[2/24/2024 12:18 PM] antonb
On what chain? Are other assets still in your wallet?


[2/24/2024 12:18 PM] murch4459
I transferred the other ones already


[2/24/2024 12:18 PM] murch4459
Polygon


[2/24/2024 12:19 PM] antonb
Please share your wallet address, I'll try to investigate what happened.

A Soarchain moderator's account was hacked and posted an airdrop opportunity. The link went to a fake website I connected my wallet to. It then drained the DIMO and USDT, but not my MATIC. It transferred @$3.7K USDT in total.

I then went and transferred what little coins I had left, including some ETH.


[2/24/2024 12:27 PM] murch4459
Do you want the Tx hash? Not sure what you need to investigate.


[2/24/2024 12:28 PM] antonb
Have you revoked the access to this website?


[2/24/2024 12:28 PM] antonb
If it's been a drainer, you ETH assets are safe


[2/24/2024 12:29 PM] murch4459
I have set to request access everytime. I haven't opened the website since it happened.


[2/24/2024 12:32 PM] antonb
You signed 2 approval tx's, one for USDT and another one for DIMO, other assets on Polygon and other chains must be out of risk.
Send a few Matics to this addess and revoke malicious contract approval at

Any advice on what to do with my Morpheus/stETH?

Is there a timeframe associated with this?


[2/24/2024 12:54 PM] antonb
No rush, everything that they can drain they drained.

I'd better have them in deposit on the cold wallet or multisig account.

I'm not sure how to transfer them


[2/24/2024 12:56 PM] antonb
GM buddy! How can I help you today?


[2/24/2024 1:01 PM] antonb
It's not mandatory, just as advise as likely they are not at risk now, until seed phrase is backed up, in secret place and you won't give drainer contract approval again.
If you decide to move stETH to another wallet, you'll need to withdraw them from the contract (after 7 days of the initial lockup), transfer them and deposit again, but from the destination wallet. The MOR you earned is only claimable and transfarable only on May 8th.

[2/25/2024 7:52 PM] antonb
It's metamask related problem, particularly how it calculates fee. You could try to increase gas limit or try later. Another solution is to use Rabby wallet.

Weird. Is it happening when you connect the website or when initiate tx?


[2/28/2024 11:21 PM] crypto_marc
These are both from connecting to the website, when I try to connect the wallet I get the error message that you can see in the upper right corner of the W 11 machine image. If I try to connect my MM wallet an error box pops up and says ERROR - something went wrong.  I have my wallet on my W 11 machine and didn't have any issue with staking on two separate occasions or seeing the update data in the dashboard, tried to recheck two days ago and this is when I started seeing the error messages.


[2/28/2024 11:24 PM] antonb
May I ask you try:
- clear cache in your W11 browser (SHIFT + F5)
- use another browser
- use VPN?


[2/28/2024 11:25 PM] crypto_marc
will do, I already cleared the cache and that didn't work, I will try another broswer and will trun my VPN on as well and will let you know that I find out.  Thanks for the assist on this.

[2/28/2024 11:49 PM] crypto_marc
Turned on my VPN and tried servers in different countries using Brave Browser and getting the same errors, no idea what is going on as everything worked fine for my couple of deposits and this all started a couple of days ago and no updates or changes to the system I am using and have cleared everything and restarted a couple of times.


[2/28/2024 11:51 PM] antonb

Just to be sure, are you able to get access to your dashboard from another PC?


[2/28/2024 11:52 PM] crypto_marc
Correct, I just tried again on my W 10 machine and all updated data is present on the dashboard, "Total Deposits 108242.8523 stETH"  and when I try to connect my MM wallet the

Can I ask you to give it one more try? To install Rabby wallet and connect it (with any address) to the website, so we can understand if the problem with MM.


[2/29/2024 12:08 AM] crypto_marc
Trying now, my guess is that is isn't the wallet since the dashboard data isn't populating on my W 11 machine but will give it a try

thanks in advance


[2/29/2024 3:37 AM] antonb
Everything is ok, you successfully deposited stETH and rewards have begun to accrue. There is a chance that amount is too small yet to be indicated in the dashboard.

ok do we have a kind of indication or math to estimate the MOR token we gain given the sEth ?

@magpow There is no specific fix of the problem as its solely from the ollama side. It's been fixed in 0.0.6.
So you have options to:
- reinstall
- try to run this before entering the morpheus command
/usr/lib/morpheus/resources/app/src/service/ollama/runners/ollama-linux$ ./ollama serve
- use 0.0.6 which is being tested / packaged

Explanation depends on your level of tech knowledge, so I'll provide the simplest first.
You'll need to run a node if you want to interact with your smart agent on your PC.
You can think of node as software that allow you to communicate with Morpheus network. When Smart Agent is the AI that can connect to your wallet and interact with smart contracts on your behalf

Hi. You don't need to have the call or ask for permission. If you want to list MOR when it's live, go for it.
Morpheus has no formal team, founders or registered entity. This is open source community owned project.


[3/2/2024 11:18 AM] yeshidolma
@antonb | will not DM you  I have just run Node from source of this repo https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Node/tree/main. What is the different with Smart Agents from repo: https://github.com/SmartAgentProtocol/SmartAgents

One is for Morpheus node and another is for smart agents


[3/2/2024 1:43 PM] yeshidolma
sorry but I unable to differentiator between them. Could you explain for me?


[3/2/2024 1:45 PM] antonb
If you could elaborate more of exact point you have hard time to find explanation for, this would help a lot. Do both of repos seem similar to you?

Hi whats up, I am new here


[3/2/2024 1:52 PM] yeshidolma
What is the different between Morpheus Node and Smart Agents?


[3/2/2024 2:02 PM] antonb
Here is the answer I gave you lately.
https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1183666837460897832/1213129065247023134

And here are a few more:
- you can think of Morpheus node as your smartphone and Smart Agent is the main application in it.
- Smart agent is personal general purpose AIs that can execute Smart Contracts on your behalf.
- Morpheus node is the software, usually run on PC, that allows you to participate in Morpheus.

I hope this addresses your question.


[3/2/2024 2:08 PM] yeshidolma
very clear, so we will have many SmartAgents right? And how to depoly owner smartcontract into SmartAgent


[3/2/2024 2:24 PM] antonb
Yes, there will be many smart agents according to a user needs and interests, also there will be a marketplace of different apps built on top of Morpheus. More information about you can find in the whitepaper.
I don't think it's possible to deploy SM into SA as this is essentially just an LLM that is run locally or by compute providers, but you will be able to deploy the owner SC with help of SA by ordering him with corresponding task.


[3/2/2024 2:27 PM] yeshidolma
I have just run code from this repo: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Node/tree/main. But I do not see any p2p connection, build block or something like that. It does not same with other node of blockchain that I was run


[3/2/2024 2:28 PM] yeshidolma
I same BE, FE that run ollama AI help user transfer coin


[3/2/2024 2:33 PM] antonb
It might worth to give another re-read to the whitepaper to understand Morpheus better.
Morpheus node doesn't run the blockchain, allowing it to help validate transactions and keep the network secure, it has different purpose.
Current 0.0.5 release is a local LLM, while 0.0.6. will have web3 wallet connection and 0.0.7 will be able to do some magic with smart contracts. Eventually it will evolve to the node you can use as your local Smart Agent or Provide Compute/Connect your apps with Morpheus.


[3/2/2024 2:38 PM] yeshidolma
"Morpheus is designed to incentivize the first peer-to-peer network of personal general purpose AIs that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user, known as Smart Agents" from WP of Morpheus

So you can enter the website, but can't connect, right?


[3/2/2024 6:41 PM] antonb
There are two possible ways to fix it:
- use of VPN
- temporary disable other wallet extensions as they provoke conflict with MM


[3/2/2024 10:37 PM] yeshidolma
@antonb | will not DM you  How to build new SmartAgent bro? I want to build one SmartAgent for some usecase

@antonb | will not DM you when staked steth can you add more a day later? and does the 90 day get extended with 1 day then ?


[3/2/2024 11:05 PM] antonb
You can add more to your deposit at any moment, but keep in mind that your balance will be locked up for 7 days again. 
90 days you mentioned is the bootstrapping period, when protocol accumulates stETH yield to create initial liquidity on Uniswap Arbitrum. Emissions don't stop accrue after 90 days, they are constant function of the protocol.


[3/2/2024 11:06 PM] trdrfmu
but under 10 stEth staked is not much then


[3/2/2024 11:06 PM] trdrfmu
0.00724 mor for 0.23 steth daily


[3/2/2024 11:07 PM] antonb
Please utilize this calculator to know exact amount

[3/3/2024 4:31 AM] steventammy
Can someone help me with staking on Metamask


[3/3/2024 4:32 AM] steventammy
I approved the transaction like 4 times and it said Approved on Etherscan. But I don‚Äôt see my stETH being staked on the website‚Ä¶


[3/3/2024 4:32 AM] steventammy
It deducted my gas fees 4 times but all of which did not deduct my stETH


[3/3/2024 4:32 AM] antonb
Please give me your address, so I can check what's wrong


[3/3/2024 4:33 AM] steventammy
I‚Äôm literally panicking cuz it deducted like $40 for nothing

My stETH is still in my wallet


[3/3/2024 4:34 AM] steventammy
But my gas fees were deducted from staking nothing


[3/3/2024 4:34 AM] antonb
Ok, I got it. Will get back soon


[3/3/2024 4:35 AM] steventammy

Do u use telegram?

[3/3/2024 4:36 AM] steventammy
Possible to pm me on there


[3/3/2024 4:36 AM] steventammy
Cuz I can‚Äôt send pictures here for some reason to this group


[3/3/2024 4:36 AM] antonb
When you enter the sum for staking, try to reduce amount a little, like 0.599
Approve button should turn green Deposit


[3/3/2024 4:37 AM] steventammy
Oh so I enter 0.599?


[3/3/2024 4:37 AM] antonb
Yes, just try, no need to sign tx


[3/3/2024 4:37 AM] steventammy
Ok will the gas fees be deducted for the 5th time though? üò≠


[3/3/2024 4:38 AM] antonb
No, you won't initiate the tx


[3/3/2024 4:38 AM] steventammy
I‚Äôm confused üòÇ


[3/3/2024 4:38 AM] antonb
Just try to reduce amount and tell me if the button turned to green with DEPOSIT word?


[3/3/2024 4:39 AM] steventammy
Aren‚Äôt I the one initiating the tan though since it‚Äôs deposit on my end


[3/3/2024 4:39 AM] steventammy
Yes


[3/3/2024 4:39 AM] steventammy
But even with 0.5995 the deposit button is still green


[3/3/2024 4:40 AM] steventammy
Or hitting max as well


[3/3/2024 4:40 AM] antonb
You can click Deposit now. When signing tx, please verify if it has Stake type.


[3/3/2024 4:41 AM] steventammy
Yes there‚Äôs still gas fees it seems


[3/3/2024 4:41 AM] steventammy
When I click deposit


[3/3/2024 4:42 AM] antonb
Yes, any tx cost gas fee.


[3/3/2024 4:42 AM] antonb
You can wait for the moment when gas price will be lowers, so you can save this way


[3/3/2024 4:43 AM] steventammy
I‚Äôm using my phone on metamask if that helps


[3/3/2024 4:43 AM] steventammy
Yea now it‚Äôs like $40

[3/3/2024 4:50 AM] antonb
You might have white screen. It's metamask issue. Use built-in MM browser and enter https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/
After that you'll be able to connect your mobile wallet

[3/3/2024 4:53 AM] steventammy
So I have to do it on an external browser?


[3/3/2024 4:55 AM] antonb
You can do on both, but don't sign any approval txs anymore. 
You have to click DEPOSIT button and initiate stake tx that will finally send your stETH to the contract.


[3/3/2024 4:56 AM] steventammy
ooooh


[3/3/2024 4:56 AM] steventammy

[3/3/2024 4:57 AM] steventammy

What‚Äôs the expected gas fees just so I know


[3/3/2024 4:59 AM] steventammy
Cuz the approval txn was $14 for one


[3/3/2024 4:59 AM] antonb
AFAIK, it's ~$15-17 at 20gwei


[3/3/2024 4:59 AM] steventammy

I would suggest trying from computer it might work it might not but definitely wait for gas prices to drop

[3/3/2024 4:30 PM] steventammy
Actually how do u claim MOR tokens after the 90 day period


[3/3/2024 4:30 PM] steventammy
On Arbitrum?


[3/3/2024 4:31 PM] antonb
At the same website, using the claim button and receiving MOR on the Arb chain


[3/3/2024 4:31 PM] steventammy
Oh so I have to open up an Arbitrum wallet?


[3/3/2024 4:32 PM] steventammy
Cuz my current wallet is on ETH chain


[3/3/2024 4:34 PM] antonb
Arbitrum is EVM chain, so you'll have the same address, you'll just need to change chain from ETH to Arb and bridge some ETH to pay fees (they are like ten-twenty times cheaper than in Eth mainnet)


[3/3/2024 4:34 PM] steventammy
Also what does this mean actually ‚ÄúIn case of claim, tokens will be minted in the Arbitrum One network. This may take some time.‚Äù


[3/3/2024 4:34 PM] steventammy
Ah I see kinda new to this


[3/3/2024 4:37 PM] antonb
Nothing complicated, just don't sign approval 4 times in a row üòÅ


[3/3/2024 4:38 PM] antonb
You can always ask here if unsure of something


[3/3/2024 4:38 PM] steventammy
ü§£ü§£ü§£ yea I‚Äôll check that next time


[3/3/2024 4:38 PM] steventammy
^what does this mean?


[3/3/2024 4:56 PM] antonb
It means what I've already explained. You will be able to claim token on the website by providing tx on ETH mainnet and will get MOR tokens on Arbitrum chain.

You don't need to approve infinite amount. It's suggested by default, you can enter the amount you want to deposit, but if you decide to add more stETH, you'll be asked to approve again (and pay fee).

And the spending cap amount, must use site suggestion or I can set it up to  my steth max amount?


[3/6/2024 8:59 PM] quan6366
Ok


[3/6/2024 8:59 PM] antonb
You can set the amount you want for deposit plus maybe 0.001 ETH more


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] quan6366
Approved and deposited


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] antonb
Congrats you are Capital Provider now! üéâ


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] quan6366
But then asked me to approve another 1 transaction, add arbitrum and ask to switch


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] quan6366
Pay another gas fee to do it


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] quan6366
I approved again


[3/6/2024 9:10 PM] quan6366
Correct?


[3/6/2024 9:11 PM] antonb
Can you provide me your address, so I can look at txs you made?


[3/6/2024 9:14 PM] quan6366
Correct?


[3/6/2024 9:15 PM] antonb
Let me check


[3/6/2024 9:17 PM] antonb
There are only two txs, approval + deposit, so everything is how it supposed to be üôÇ


[3/6/2024 9:17 PM] quan6366
Ohhh


[3/6/2024 9:17 PM] quan6366
So no issue right?


[3/6/2024 9:18 PM] antonb
No, as far as I can see in blockchain


[3/6/2024 9:18 PM] quan6366
Regarding the second approval, add MOR token and  arbitrum network, it is a must?


[3/6/2024 9:18 PM] quan6366
Cause I do not see this step from community youtuber


[3/6/2024 9:19 PM] antonb
Ahh, you might be asked to add MOR to token list in your MM


[3/6/2024 9:20 PM] antonb
This is solely for your convenience, either way you need to add it manually.


[3/6/2024 9:22 PM] quan6366
My ledger wallet showed 0 steth now


[3/6/2024 9:23 PM] quan6366
I will get my steth back to my wallet again only after I withdraw steth?


[3/6/2024 9:24 PM] quan6366
Or it suppose to show up somewhere in my wallet?


[3/6/2024 9:24 PM] antonb
Yesm it's now staked in the contract and you'll be able to withdraw after 7 days.


[3/6/2024 9:24 PM] quan6366
Sorry, quite new to stake and deposit steth


[3/6/2024 9:25 PM] antonb
You can see deposited amount on the website


[3/6/2024 9:25 PM] quan6366
For the withdrawal, only the deposit address can do the withdrawal right


[3/6/2024 9:26 PM] antonb

Hello.
It's usually enough to post your question in only one channel in order to be answered üôÇ

May I know what is the service/wallet you use that asks you to whitelist contracts?


[3/7/2024 12:10 PM] antonb
Got it.
Yes, you are going to interact with two contracts, the first one is stETH to approve the amount and Morpheus distribution contract as spender. And second is the Morpheus distribution contract itself to be able to deposit funds. 
Did you get the addresses from #üìöÔ∏±verified-links ?


[3/7/2024 12:14 PM] antonb
That's right, both contracts are on ethereum mainnet

Desktop


[3/7/2024 1:26 PM] antonb
You need to disable other extension wallets as it cause conflict with Metamask.


[3/7/2024 1:26 PM] jk1235559
How do I disable that


[3/7/2024 1:27 PM] antonb

[3/8/2024 1:45 AM] antonb
Might be llama or mistral, but as Morpheus is model-agnostic any open-source LLM will be accessible.


[3/8/2024 1:46 AM] richardkingxyz
ty ty 

anyone doing training with on-chain data and running open models?


[3/8/2024 1:47 AM] antonb
It's to early for that, Morpheus has just launched a month ago. The next milestone, tentatively in May, is Compute.


[3/8/2024 2:29 AM] richardkingxyz
ah ok, any thoughst bout bittensor?


[3/8/2024 3:08 AM] antonb
Bittensor is a blockchain with customizable software built on top to help train AI models. Morpheus isn't trying to train models, but focused on infrastructure for Smart Agents  and not the blockchain.

[3/9/2024 9:21 PM] trdrfmu
If i stake stEth i get rewarded each day but if i withdraw it after 7 days do my rewards go on untill 8 may? or do they stop after withdrawing my  st ETH


[3/9/2024 9:22 PM] antonb
You get rewards every block after deposit and they stop accrue when you withdraw.


[3/9/2024 9:32 PM] trdrfmu
So rewards stop if you withdraw back?


[3/9/2024 9:33 PM] trdrfmu
What if i withdraw and stake the funds again couple hours later


[3/9/2024 9:44 PM] antonb
Let me put it this way:
Funds in the contract - you receive rewards.
Funds not in contract - you don't get rewards

However I can't


[3/23/2024 12:00 AM] antonb
It's correct as each deposit triggers 7 days lock. 
If you deposited on 17th, you will be able to withtdraw on 24th, but exact date and time you can see in your dashboard.

Hi. You can think of Morpheus like technology as there is no formal team, founders or entity, but a community of passionate open source contributors. 
But you can utilize Morpheus as a user or contributor.

For 0.0.5  it was 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core.

If i continue to stake stETH until May 8 do I get more (maximize) my MOR token claim? thx


[3/28/2024 3:12 AM] antonb
Your MOR rewards mostly depends on your share in the total stETH deposited pool. There is no specific time/date that would help you maximize your earnings.


[3/28/2024 3:13 AM] antonb
You get MOR rewards when stETH is in the contract, if you withdraw, rewards won't accrue.


[3/28/2024 3:14 AM] geezer_06211
So I am accruing MOR token rewards as long as i do NOT withdraw my stETH? If yes, then when does rewards period end?


[3/28/2024 3:20 AM] antonb
In fact, it is not going to end in the next 256 years. 16 years of the initial emission curve and 250 years for tail emissions. üôÇ

It's up to you. If you ask me, I'm not going to withdraw my stETH in the near future, as it's safely stored in the contract (and I can withdraw any moment) and provides me with MOR rewards.
Patience is the key.

That's correct understanding. May 8th is the end of the bootstrapping period when AMM liquidity is deployed and everyone can claim their MOR token rewards on Arbitrum.

currently using base foundation models, they do fairly well given that a lot of web3 info is part of the corpus used in pretraining, since it's inherently open and part of public record.

there are some groups working on finetuning models for increased performance, agentic behavior, and optimized model sizes (smaller)

After a few days, I found that it was pengding all the time. I clicked on acceleration and found that it was invalid. I clicked on cancel again, but there was no response when canceling. Now the transaction ID is displayed as unable to be found at https://etherscan.io/.
On March 29, after learning that the stack had not ended. I stacked stETH that was not stacked successfully again, and the transaction ID was 0x23b295125cdf79c06eab5a9fd32c62cebd1fddffd6f29c3e08297c6ba9646a69. The current display must be completed after the previous transaction is completed. This is so frustrating, please help me, thank you. By the way, staking should be done on the ETH mainnet, right?

Hi, I've installed Morpheus and am trying to connect my browser extension metamask. When I click on connect I see a QR code but I'm not sure what to do with it? How do I get my metamask to see the QR code? Also when I ask it the question "How do I connect my browser's metamask wallet?" it sits there an loads indefinitely with my computer fan beginning to spin very loudly.

[4/3/2024 11:19 AM] economicsjunkie
Also after some time clicking the connect button on the top right doesn't do anything at all


[4/3/2024 11:33 AM] economicsjunkie
OK, I've installed metamask on my phone so i was able to scan the qr code and connect. now when i say for example "buy eth" it sits there and thinks forever. What am I doing wrong?


[4/3/2024 11:50 AM] antonb
I'll try to find out what happened.

There must be another connection icon called Browser Wallet, please try using it.

> Also when I ask it the question "How do I connect my browser's metamask wallet?" it sits there an loads indefinitely 
This is very first and experimental version of the Smart Agent that's optimized for some simple prompts as:
"What is my balance?"
"What is my address?"
"Send ETH to Ethereum Address"
More functionality is to come.

You have two txs pending.
One of them is cancel tx with deadly low gas fee ~1,6gwei. You need to cancel it first (yes, cancel the cancel transaction), then another tx, which is stETH approval with ~28gwei fee will be approved.

Here is the instruction how to do that manually. You need to use Method 2: Custom nonce.

Hey üñêÔ∏è Just tested the 0.0.2 locally with an own model and works fine so far. üëç 

Some ideas: Instead of developing an own UI, why not copying existing ones that works? Like https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui That already much more advanced and also based on ollama.

I think both is great. The reference Morpheus client should have its own UI, but lets ENCOURAGE others to build their own GUIs.


[11/6/2023 2:32 AM] hvbx
Sure, on the long run. The idea came to my mind, because the current UI is far away from having a good UX for "the general public" and isn't feature complete. So starting with an already known UI that is closer to be feature-complete what be a nice start. Then this UI could be developed to an own unique Morpheus UI.

Link to download.


[11/30/2023 1:47 AM] smartagents
This version of Morpheus has two improvements.
1. You can add Files to add knowledge to the AI.
2. When installing you still need Ollama, but now it skips the Terminal step. 
So just drag and drop install Ollama as the 2nd step, but it shouldn't make you take any steps on the Terminal.


[11/30/2023 1:48 AM] smartagents
To test please uninstall Ollama then install Morpheus 0.0.4 and then reinstall Ollama and let us know if it works.

Hey guys
When do you think we can expect a windows node?


[12/1/2023 2:52 AM] taddymason1
If I'm not mistaken, it's dependent upon Ollama releasing a version for Windows. Due to that constraint, there is no timeline on a Windows release for Morpheus


[12/1/2023 2:54 AM] bv_8
That‚Äôs really unfortunate 
Is there no possible workaround? 
I‚Äôm not saying windows is the best os but the average Joe like myself  runs on windows, so if we want mass adoption it‚Äôs important to be able to setup a node on the most used platform


[12/1/2023 2:56 AM] taddymason1
Im with you, I'm a Windows Joe too. As of right now, I do not think there is a workaround üò¶

on Morpheus initalization (first boot), is the app downloading large files? I've seen CLI errors about failed downloads and can't get initalized. (running on ubuntu). Ollama is running and available.

i think it's an issue with Ollama not supporting older AMD processors, not with Morpheus.

Do what you think will help teach people about Morpheus. Could be a video, website, talks, meetup. 
Morpheus doesn't have roles or a formal "team". No marketing team at Bitcoin either : )
With that said. Love the passion. As each type of reward gets clarified it will be more clear how to mine rewards. The Community Builders reward seems aimed at those that create front ends or other tools for users to access Morpheus. Ideas welcome. All open community here.

[12/6/2023 11:59 PM] kblkusamakingdom
How will the distribution of tokens for these sort of things be decided?


[12/7/2023 6:07 AM] smartagents
Good question. I think everything has to be reflected in a quantifiable manor.
So lets say a Guide gets added to the Morpheus Github. And actually merged by the Github devs, then it should count toward the coder bucket of MOR rewards. Code rewards are being calculated via Full Time Equivalent, so say if the guide took 1 hour to make and 1,000 hours of coding has been merged into the Github by developers then the guide creator would get 1 / 1,000 of the MOR rewards for the Coder rewards.


[12/7/2023 12:08 PM] lexilier
do you have any approx timeline of when mining could start, testnet or mainnet either and also wallet release


[12/7/2023 2:33 PM] kblkusamakingdom
So still involves quite a lot of trust and judgement. 

1) By the creator on stating how much time it took them 
2) By the github devs who will decide what gets merged?

Not that i can see a much better way atm.  You would imagine Morpheus would write its own guides one day ü§Ø  or be able to quantify all contributions to it.


[12/7/2023 9:42 PM] smartagents
Yeah, seems the best approach available. 
But think of it as a market for code where the dev is the seller and the Github admin is the buyer.

1. If the developer claims too high and amount of time say 100 hour for a few lines of code the Github dev is unlikely to accept the merge and dilute their own contributions.

2. I expect over time there will be multiple Github / repos for Morpheus in different languages and implementations similar to how Ethereum has multiple clients. So people will have multiple "buyers" of their code".

In both cases we are talking about the Morpheus Client, but half the code rewards go to those creating Smart Agents. There anyone can without permission make an agent, offer it to the market and get rewarded pro-rata to the MOR fees spent interacting with it. Like releasing an App on the App Store devs are rewarded based on usage / users paying them.

Hey everyone -- asking about a small clarification on the community builders allocation. Is the calculation of community builder rewards solely on users burning tokens on the Morpheus network while using the tool / front-end that was developed? It's a little unclear how the burning of MOR is linked to the value of a community builder's contribution.


[12/14/2023 8:04 PM] cybourgeoisie
Also - if MOR is locked up for the first 90 days, how is this calculated before the end of the bootstrap period?


[12/14/2023 11:05 PM] smartagents
Good questions. Seems like there is a diagram needed to show these flows of transactions between Community Builders creating demand for inference and Compute Providers creating supply of inference. @cybourgeoisie


[12/15/2023 8:10 AM] auggiespqr
I had a similar question; how are community builders' contributions calculated during the bootstrap period, when MOR cannot be sent?


[12/15/2023 9:45 AM] smartagents
Consumption of useful inference would be the obvious one. But without MOR to use for transactions or Staking that would seem to have to be done manually. I'll set up part of the Github for people to register. Then their provision of Inference would need to be validated. Important part to work on pre-boot strap period.

Could I ask why frontends and app developers called community builders? Every time I read WP it confuse me a bit, as community builders usually refers to influencers and people who educate, grow, create content and manages communities. 

Would it be possible to rename Coders to Core Devs or Core Contributors 
and Community to App builders, which will more accurately reflect the essence?

[1/5/2024 9:38 AM] smartagents
Community Builders definitely needs more detail maybe even a dedicated paper similar to what Yellowstone did for Compute. The Whitepaper describes it at a high level covering everything from front ends, to tools, to creating demand for BPE Tokens / Inference and brings use into the Morpheus Ecosystem.


[1/5/2024 9:40 AM] smartagents
One way I think of it is in the context of Community Builders supporting the other three functions in Morpheus. So creating demand for Compute, creating demand for Capital, creating demand for Code.


[1/5/2024 9:43 AM] smartagents
The Capital demand is fairly straight forward to prove. 
The Compute demand with the Yellowstone approach should be a matter of tracking the demand for Tokens.
The Code is maybe the hardest, but with the Smart Agent devs registering their addresses and then tracking BPE Tokens demanded it should be quantifiable.


[1/5/2024 9:43 AM] smartagents
I'll take on writing a draft this week.


[1/5/2024 8:53 PM] antonb
> The Code is maybe the hardest, but with the Smart Agent devs registering their addresses and then tracking BPE Tokens demanded it should be quantifiable.

As I understood the process, there will be a group of Core members who will assess contribution and accept/decline pull requests to Github. (there must be strict criteria to avoid possible conflicts) What I can't get is that how much time your contribution will earn you rewards? You can't contribute ones and get rewards forever, the best practice is to incentivize devs to deliver their share continuously to maintain the reward.


[1/5/2024 8:55 PM] antonb
Another point that makes me curious, is there a way to be rewarded for guys like me (non technical), but with business and community building background? For instance, I could make a translation of WP and testnet docs, write some guides and articles.


[1/5/2024 11:15 PM] smartagents
There are no "core members". Governance in Morpheus using the concept of Atomic Governance. As in each Github repo has its own developers who make their own decisions. Different devs working on Smart Contracts, Nodes, Installs, Tools, Agents. I don't think most of them have met or know each other and maybe half are Anon.


[1/5/2024 11:16 PM] smartagents
Yes. 100% anyone who contributed to a paper or guide or anything added / merged to the Github should get hours counted in the Code calculation. I did a survey and so far I've found 123 people who can commented, reviewed, edited, edited, or written contributions to the different Github repositories connected to Morpheus.


[1/5/2024 11:17 PM] smartagents
Now those 123 people just have to submit a pull request with their ETH address and get their hours accepted by the Github manager.


[1/5/2024 11:19 PM] smartagents
I'm sure there will need to be some dust level. But as written every Code contributors gets MOR rewards pro-rata to their contribution for the whole Morpheus reward period (16 years for the first Epoch). Its the same for stETH contributors, any contribution above the dust level is rewarded.


[1/5/2024 11:20 PM] smartagents
Of course as additional hours get added to the Code the amount of the contribution is diluted by everyone else, so it would expect the rewards to decline over time as the Morpheus Code base grows.


[1/5/2024 11:22 PM] smartagents
Practical point.
Morpheus Whitepaper, Yellowpaper, Yellowstone and other major material would be great to see translated into Spanish, German, Russian, Ukrainian and other major languages. (Chinese is done and Japanese is already in the works).


[1/5/2024 11:31 PM] antonb
There must be people or person who make a final decision, I'd call him/them as founder or core members. IMO.
How do all these devs coordinate with each other?


[1/5/2024 11:33 PM] antonb
I can take RU and UA. What's the process of submission? Should it be txt doc?


[1/5/2024 11:51 PM] smartagents
Well in the Morpheus architecture anyone can run the code they want, they can run the Smart Agents they want, they can run any models they want. Everything is a free market for Code, Capital, Compute, and Community interfaces. So I'll just respect each person based on their Contributions rather than titles. Mostly I see titles as people seeking power over others. For a credibility neutral platform like Morpheus I love that there is no CEO, no Founders, No Company, No Foundation.

@SmartAgents Hello I have a question I am busy translating the whitepaper to my language but I came across a problem that I don't know how to upload my translated png's may I ask where I can upload them to put the link in my md file?


[1/18/2024 6:14 AM] mahalleinirx
If you upload them into assets in the github I think you can call them from there


[1/19/2024 1:49 AM] bullfluencer
I have a little problem with the uploading the pictures is it necessary to translate them or can they also be in English like I saw on some other white papers? @The Oracle @SmartAgents


[1/19/2024 3:59 AM] mahalleinirx
It will be better if they are translated however you can use the english one's and if you can provide the translated versions we can see about getting them on there after the fact


[1/19/2024 4:08 AM] groundfloor2085
I can help out, I'll DM @Bull

My team HyperOracle is releasing onchain AI oracle for any smart contract to use LLM permissionlessly. Previously we invented opML to deploy and verify ML models (SD, LLaMA 2) onchain directly, see https://ai.hyperoracle.io Is this a good place to share the oracle with fellow community builders and discuss/propose integration?

Couple of thoughts here.
1. Might be best to put this in the Meme channel. 
2. These NFTs as I understand them aren't a Front End to the Morpheus Smart Contracts or the Full Nodes so the Community Builder (Front Ends is the wrong channel). 
3. So best to avoid confusion a couple days out from the fair launch that this is unrelated to the stETH yield contribution Capital Provider Mechansim.

I understand the idea is for the community builders to `send a MOR transaction to the Community Builder Smart Contract to register the API endpoint for receiving requests` but I could not find any smart contract that has this capability in the testnet. `5.FairLaunch.md`  says that `However the Smart Contracts will not distribute the MOR tokens to Community Builders until the Community Smart Contracts and other details are developed by the community`. Is the expectation that the community will first build these contracts and once deployed, only then their apps can be launched?


[2/8/2024 10:05 AM] mahalleinirx
Correct, community contracts need to exist first

You can learn some from the #‚ùìÔ∏±faqs 
But essentially there are 4 categories you can contribute by:
- provide capital (stETH)
- provide code to Morpheus Github
- provide compute resources (not live yet)
- build apps/tools on Morpheus

I started a new project on X last week called Bryptos (@BryptosNews on X). The concept is a media channel covering the bitcoin/crypto space in short AI generated videos.

The very first new project I came across was Morpheus and now I'm hooked. I want to morph Bryptos into a Morpheus project.

Sample of a news-style post:
https://twitter.com/MorpheusMinute/status/1757100238358167832

We can also create posts that act as basic primers on aspects of the system, i.e. 4 Cs, PoL, AMMs, tokenomics, etc, and some that discuss interfaces.

What do you think?

Hello, I have a unique proposition that I believe falls under community building.

I am in charge of The Block's podcasts (https://twitter.com/TheBlockPods), and I would like to setup an episode of The Block Research Podcast that focuses on Morpheus. I'd like to invite a handful of passionate Morpheus community members on the show to share what they are working on, and to unpack the value proposition for Morpheus.

However, that's only half of my proposal...

In addition to running The Block's podcasts, I am also building a web3 community for The Block that attempts to demonstrate the unique advantages of Web3 for the creator economy. As part of this experience, we have a community treasury that is used to incentivize co-creation bounties, and reward community members based on an XP system.

If the Morpheus community decides funding an episode of The Block Research Podcast is a worthwhile educational endeavor, then I would like to propose all $MOR received from the partnership is deposited directly into the community wallet. Members of The Block community would then be free to discuss how to use the $MOR, and we would ultimately decide via onchain governance.

Here are some data estimates that might be useful in assessing this proposal...

Assets: 1x full length episode of The Block Research Podcast & 2-3 clips for social media
Estimated Exposure: 10,000-25,000 full episode views & 50,000-100,000+ impressions
Time requirement: ~10 Hours

Hey all, I am interested in building a workflow for entrepreneurs on top of TCM so that they can move from ideation to business as quickly as an idea spreads through social media. I think that businesses can chart an entirely new iterative path where they can begin through the process of sharing an idea, rewarding people who participate in altering and evolving it, derisking customer aquisition and product/market fit along the way, and advancing the idea through agents as it proves its popularity or stickiness to a point where investment or scaling feel all but inevitable.. wondering the best way to find others with the same mindset or a good place to start üôÇ  Excited to be here

Yah I read that one. And agree a compute type system could make sense as a reward model. 

For example, Ethena.fi which recently launched has a compute reward model (aka referral tracking). 

So if I was to build a similar system for Morpheus, such that users could invite their network through a personal invite URL to be able to assign downloads to a specific referrer, and then subsequently track MOR acquired/staked by these users, is that something that would fall under "Community apps" or is "Code-Providers"? 

Also, would the reward be based on MOR purchased by those users? MOR staked by the users? Number of installs? Active users? 

Probably MOR staked balance would make most sense...


[2/21/2024 6:55 PM] antonb
> users could invite their network through a personal invite URL
I think this logic can be implemented on the app level.


[2/21/2024 6:57 PM] 0x_trinity
in this context, do you consider Morpheus 0.06 to be an "App"?


[2/21/2024 6:59 PM] antonb
In case of AI app builders there is a following logic:
Morpheus => App builder => end user
That implies that for the most of the end users nothing changes, they will use the same cool apps from app or google store and pay in the way they used to.
App builders in this schema are incentivized to accumulate MOR to get access to a bigger chunk of "free" daily compute and if it exhausted, they just buy more for MOR.


[2/21/2024 7:00 PM] antonb
Can't say about app, but you'll be able to connect your wallet and give some orders to your smart agent.


[2/21/2024 7:24 PM] 0x_trinity
@SmartAgents keen to get your take on this too - if I wanted to build this referral mechanism, would the best approach be to fork 0.06 and then add this referral mechanism directly in the fork? And would you consider this to then be an "App"?

I'm closer to business and marketing rather dev side, so can assume that Morpheus, as web3 native, will get initial adoption from crypto audience. 
The list of possible areas can include:
- Smart Agents that maximize users' ROI
- Airdrop hunting AI bots
- Analytical AIs provide insights on market situation/trends
- AI crypto investigation and cybersecurity tools
- AI bots that can act as community managers
- AI tools that help managing different tasks (incl app development)

https://65ef171c0045e665e76f0b73--keen-alfajores-3ce4aa.netlify.app

More features incoming, will be developing it as the project grows (some initial ideas is USD worth once token launches, ability to withdraw/add to the pool, better url - getting a domain name,...)

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[3/13/2024 8:49 PM] antonb
I thinks that the number of total weights distributed is off (4669) as contract gives ~23400


[3/13/2024 8:53 PM] oreo_mev
this is the exact number that I got (wrote a parser that parses from github data), so there might be mistake in github table formatting ? will verify...

Just to verify that my understanding is correct: next month (8th of April) all contributions from new file will be added to original Code-Proof_Of_ContributionSnapshot3.md->  Code - Proof_Of_Contribution.md ?

This would be ideal, but can adapt my script if needed


[3/13/2024 8:54 PM] antonb
They won't be added to the file Code - Proof_Of_Contribution.md, but to the contract. There will be new table for each snapshot


[3/13/2024 9:00 PM] oreo_mev
ok so let me verify this:

random user account: 0xfe17147301888fBEEc36be3a8e6E4f883496ed33
on github he has 3 entries, totalling 1860 weights
but on the contract he has 2642

My guess is that the contract is the absolute truth, but where did the extra weights came from (was there some earlier documents giving out weights or something) ?


[3/13/2024 9:01 PM] antonb
Let me check this

{Reactions}
üëç 

[3/13/2024 10:21 PM] oreo_mev
I found an extra distribution transaction that was done before the Code contribution file was created on github, probably initial weights distributed for work, done before everything was public on github? Please confirm:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3865d63f1f4aa46c7c45dccd3ada0f3a81eff5fe66e757ac0fef074269497cab#eventlog

If confirmed, will create new file and pull request so this table is also added to the repo, as I believe this is the best option for an open source project (Visibility matters, this is why I started creating this tool of mine)

To whom is your question addressed and why are you asking it here? For the future, please refrain from posting any links unless asked to do so.


[3/15/2024 2:26 PM] upnode
It's for a general idea on distributing reward to the contribution

In Optimism RetroPGF, they let builders submit their contribution / projects in season.

Then they have a set of judges called badgeholders who filter out spam submission and after that, vote on how much token each project should get.

Then the allocation is normalized to a fixed total budget.

Would like to see if this model can be adopted with Morpheus


[3/15/2024 2:34 PM] antonb
I can't see the possibility of this approach to be implemented in Morpheus due to community owned structure with no team and founders with per block emissions opposed to treasury in Optimism.

@everyone Please be careful of any offer to buy or sell MOR tokens. Buying / selling MOR is impossible during this period. The Smart Contracts are not yet on mainnet and even after the Smart Contracts are deployed on Mainnet, MOR tokens are not claimable / sendable for the first 90 days (during the boot strapping period).

I've seen this question very often, so I thought it best to make this post to everyone. Remember there is NO pre-mine so anyone claiming to have MOR for sale is not being truthful.

As described in the white paper, the only way to get MOR tokens is to earn it yourself from providing Code, Capital, Community or Compute to the network. Its all fair launch. Love the energy and passion of everyone here. It is so awesome to see so many people building this project in public from day one. 

Keep being awesome friends.

@everyone To answer the frequent questions about the testing process, I've written up this Testing Plan proposal for the Morpheus Smart Contracts. Included on Github and below. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/TestingPlan.md
# Testing Plan For Smart Contracts & Bootstrapping Period
Stage 0: Development version of Smart Contracts Deployed on Testnet - Complete
Stage 1: Open source developers publish the source code - Complete
Stage 2: Colleagues of original devs test the Smart Contracts - In Progress
Stage 3: Community members test for vulnerabilities - In Progress
Stage 4: Dedicated testing firm reviews the Smart Contracts on testnet - In Progress
Stage 5: Smart Contracts deployed on Ethereum / Arbitrum mainnet - Pending
Stage 6: Full audit of Smart Contracts during the 90 day boot strapping period - Pending
Stage 7: Day 90 of the bootstrapping period the AMM is created using the Protection Fund.
Stage 8: Remove admin function from Smart Contracts.
Stage 9: Additional upgrades to Smart Contracts will require effectively everyone to update the software.

@everyone Important paper just published on how to improve the Compute provider process for Morpheus. 
Thanks to @Erik Voorhees for the detailed proposal.

Note from Erik. 
"Gm Morpheus community. I've been working on a revised model suggestion for the Compute portion of Morpheus' tokenomics. Here is the paper:

https://defiant-wolfsbane-830.notion.site/Morpheus-Yellowstone-Compute-Model-2ca9b4e7e1374c898937fdbd1b964cc1

The goals were to:
Remove the ability for compute providers to game the system
Enable users to not pay per inference (ideally, to not pay at all)
Achieve efficient, scalable, and sustainable provision of permissionless compute resource without overpaying for it
Incentivize low response time and cost competition among compute Providers
Minimize number of blockchain transactions (whether L2 or otherwise)
Demonstrate an economically sound fundamental demand for MOR"

@everyone A common question has been how people can contribute to the Morpheus code base.
One really low hanging fruit is just translating the Whitepaper into your language and adding the translated version of the Whitepaper to Github. So far the Whitepaper is in English, Chinese, Dutch and I'm aware of translations in progress for Japanese,  Ukrainian, & Russian. Would be great to see Hindi, Korean, German, Polish, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Indonesian, Nigerian, Kenyan, Arabic and other common languages spoken by Web3 & AI developers around the world.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/WhitePaper.md

Thanks to everyone for the amazing translations of the White Paper. This task is now complete and there will be no further hours credited as the major languages are fairly well covered at this point. The Yellow Paper, the Yellowstone paper, and the TCM paper are all still be edited so no need to translate them at this time.

@everyone 
**Proposed Date For Morpheus Fair Launch - February 8th 2024**
Based on the progress of the Smart Contracts in the test nets and the community members who have sponsored auditors to test the Smart Contracts (thank you) it looks like the Morpheus Smart Contracts maybe **deployed to Ethereum / Arbitrum mainnet on February 8th 2024** and contributors will begin earning MOR.

This is a proposed date and it could change. But presuming the Smart Contracts continue to test well, this seems a reasonable date after the audits are complete and has been proposed by the Smart Contract developers as the date to begin the fair launch.

**Boot Strapping Period Phase 1**
The Smart Contracts will begin creating MOR token emissions for Code, Capital, Compute, and Community from day 1 however keep in mind the stETH and MOR tokens will not be claimable / sendable until day 91 after phase 1 of the bootstrapping period is complete for Code & Capital Providers.

**Boot Strapping Period Phase 2**
As part of the broader bootstrapping period but may last longer than 90 days for Compute Providers and Community Builders the Smart Contracts will build up MOR tokens rewards from day 1. However the Smart Contracts will not distribute the MOR tokens to Compute Providers and Community Builders until the Compute Router and other details are developed by the community.

**Date May Change**
So February 8th MAYBE the beginning of the 90 day bootstrapping period. Thanks to everyone who is building Morpheus open source and in public from day one. Its amazing to watch people coming together from across the world to create true a Decentralized AI for everyone to freely use.

Updated Testing Plan:
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/TestingPlan.md

History:
February 8th 2024 is the 28th Anniversary of "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" (February 8th 1996). Seems like a good day to release Decentralized AI into the world.

Thanks to @everyone who applied to the Decentralized AI Day event at ETH Denver February 28th 2024.

The event is already north of 300+ applications now (which is the max for the venue). 

Approved the first 170 people. Working through the rest of the applications this week. 

Going to be epic. Akash is sponsoring the evening party so its going to be fun : )

Join the waiting list if you haven't already.

@everyone An important aspect of the Morpheus network design that was described in the White paper is the Protection Fund mechanism which is 4% of MOR emissions. I've written up a proposal to add more details to how the Protection Fund will pay out in the case of bugs & exploits. I really think its important to have a detailed plan in advance of any issue so the community knows how the network will react in different scenarios. Feedback is very welcome.

Tl;dr
1. Fund audits to avoid bugs.
2. Fund bug bounties to resource white hat hackers to report bugs.
3. Halt the Smart Contracts in case of on going attack.
4. Pay out effected users / providers in case of loss.
5. Hard fork conditions in case of large scale issue.

@everyone The Morpheus community is pioneering a fundamentally new model to fair launch the project. After Morpheus goes live it will give other developers the tools to build their own projects, Smart Agents, & Dapps using the same Capital, Code, Compute & Community framework proven by this community. 

Here is the proposal to call this framework the "Techno Capital Machine" or TCM. A new way to launch a project, a new way to do Atomic Governance with the least friction possible for developers to just ship code and communities to support them with the Morpheus Virtual Machine (MVM).

Best meme for the paper goes to @willyfox  Draft version is live. Feedback welcome.

@everyone I'm happy to report that the dedicated audit of the Smart Contracts for Morpheus has been completed and all issues have been fixed by the Smart Contract developers and confirmed by the auditors as having been successfully closed. Big thanks to @Christopher  (Morpheus) for engaging the auditors and leading that process and contributing all the resulting code to the community.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/Testing%20Reports/report-v2%20of%20Morpheus%20Audit.pdf

As a result the February 8th 2024 proposed date for the move to Ethereum / Arbitrum seems to still be the most likely date for the beginning of the fair launch.

@everyone Open source developers have created a nice front end Dashboard for the Morpheus Smart Contracts. You can test it out using the link below. Tweaks needed for text and other details but main functions should be working on the testnet. Please add feedback, suggestions, bugs, and other details to the #‚ö°Ô∏±code-providers channel.

@everyone As the time approaches to deploy the Morpheus Smart Contracts on Ethereum & Abritrum for the fair launch process to begin, the question of the multi-signature set up has been raised. For full transparency it is wise to lay out the process of setting up the multi signature security, the experience of the key holders and how the process may evolve in the future. Please read this detailed post on Github for the details.

--Tl;dr 
Following the recommendations of the cybersecurity experts and auditors involved in testing the Smart Contracts the ‚ÄúSAFE'' software (previously known as the Gnosis SAFE) multi-signature Smart Contract will be employed to manage the keys. https://app.safe.global/welcome

- 7 key holders have been selected from the community to take part in the multi sig.
- Each key holder has deep experience in cyber security + 6 to 12 years in crypto.
- The SAFE software will be set up to require 4 of the 7 key holders to sign transactions.
- The key ceremony is being witnessed by an independent auditor.
- The key holders are jurisdictionally & geographically diverse.
- None of the key holders are members of the same company.
- Identities of the key holders will not be doxxed for obvious personal security reasons.

@everyone The Multisig key ceremony is complete. 
The address for the Morpheus multisig on Ethereum is MOR.ETH which should make things easy on users. 
Next step is for the Public Audit judging to complete tomorrow and for the devs to determine if any last issues need to be addressed before the fair launch. This will tell us if February 8th is the deployment date. Thanks to everyone who has been involved in testing the Smart Contracts step by step. Keep being awesome!
https://app.ens.domains/mor.eth

THE SMART CONTRACTS ARE NOT DEPLOYED YET. DO NOT SEND ANY ETH or stETH TO THIS ADDRESS.

@everyone The open source developers have confirmed that the Morpheus Smart Contracts will be deployed on February 8th 2024 to begin the fair launch. 

Start time is: 02.08.24 12:00 p.m. (UTC Time Zone).
Time Zone Converter To Your Local Time Thursday, February 8, 2024 7:00:00 PM

**Ethereum** Multisig Address: 0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E 
Connected to the human readable MOR.ETH for ENS purposes. 
__The Smart Contracts are NOT yet deployed do NOT send stETH to this address before the start of the fair launch.__

**Arbitrum** Multisig Address: arb1:0x151c2b49CdEC10B150B2763dF3d1C00D70C90956

The only changes from the final audit were to make the stETH withdraw period 7 days (instead of 48 hours), to avoid attackers withdrawing stETH before stETH rebasing rewards are contributed to the Morpheus Protocol Owned Liquidity (the white paper has been updated to reflect this). There may be other ways to address this in the code later, but the devs will start with 7 days as the stETH withdraw limit and assess how to improve it over time.

@everyone Fair launch for Morpheus starts February 8th at 12 pm UTC (noon). 
The only valid Multisig address is: MOR.ETH = 0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E
Smart Contract Addresses will be published tomorrow.

**Recommended to use the Dashboard Interface rather than trying to structure the transaction manually.**
Do NOT send stETH directly to the address of the Multisig that will not generate any MOR.

There is no NFT
There is no token sale
There is no airdrop

Only way to earn MOR tokens is by contributing stETH yield.
The Dashboard Interface will go live tomorrow. https://app.ens.domains/mor.eth
The image below is from the Testnet, zero testnet tokens transfer to Mainnet.
Morpheus is 100% fair launch.

Happy Morpheus Fair Launch Day @everyone  - Decentralized AI Is Here

It is with great honor that today this community is extending the Independence of Cyberspace to the realm of Intelligence. Let these Smart Agents accelerate and decentralize prosperity across the world over for all people.

There are some great community websites that give the details on the Fair Launch:
1. https://mor.org/fair-launch by @Erik Voorhees 
2. https://medium.com/@oracle_61071/morpheus-mor-launch-tl-dr-4121bd4c3295 by @The Oracle 
3. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/5.FairLaunch.md

**Tl;dr**
- You can now provide stETH (minimum of 0.011). The Smart Contracts are already live on Mainnet.
- However MOR rewards only start calculating at 12 p.m. UTC February 8th 2024, about 18 minutes from now.
**- Please do NOT send stETH directly to the Multisig address or directly to the Smart Contract address. This will not generate any MOR rewards. **
- Use the Dashboard Interface to make depositing stETH in the Smart Contract simple.
- The Dashboard is currently being switched from testnet to mainnet. 

The current Dashboard link is: https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital 
The website url may change as it goes to MOR.ETH
Step 1 is the "Approve" Transaction.
The high cap approval is expected behavior so you can do multiple deposits in the future.
Step 2 is the "Deposit" Transaction Action (2 transactions total have to be confirmed via Meta Mask) 
Push "Deposit stETH" both times in the Dashboard.

For advanced users, follow one of the community guides via a block explorer (such as Ether Scan) using the same steps as the testnet but now on mainnet. 

Looks like the Dashboard is seeing a lot of traffic. Try following this guide if the Dashboard is not loading. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/English-Guides/Morpheus%20Capital%20Providers%20Contract%20Guide.md

The Morpheus Capital Provider Smart Contract Address Is:
Ethereum: Distribution Contract: 0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
 
For those with keen eyes they will note the address that owns the Smart Contracts is not yet the multisig address. This will be updated tomorrow (transferred to the Multisig address) when the Smart Contract devs have confirmed there are no bugs or issues with the Smart Contract deployment.

Finally a huge thank you to the 100+ devs that worked on building Morpheus since September 2nd 2023 and the broader community for spreading the word about how important Decentralized AI is. This is a long term project and is being built by passionate people. Whatever challenges lie ahead I look forward to navigating them with all the builders here working to make Morpheus and the Smart Agents deployed on this platform ever better.

@everyone Quick summary of Morpheus Fair Launch (so far).

First of all. What an amazing response by the community to support Decentralized AI. 
So far 24,000+ stETH have been staked into the Capital Provider Smart Contract. 
https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital

The yield from these stETH resources will provide liquidity and support for a lot of Coders, Compute and Community Builders far into the future to extend the Morpheus platform and empower everyone building Smart Agents.

This is just the beginning. Seeing proposals for lots of ways to grow the community and tech stack in the coming weeks / months.

The upgraded Dashboard seems to be holding up to the surge of traffic. More improvements to make here and thanks to those that upgraded the Staking Guide for Mainnet and offering a back up path for Capital Providers to participate. The contract reached number 24 on the Top 50 Gas Guzzlers relative to the entire Ethereum network today.

Next up is for the transfer of the Smart Contracts to the multisig tomorrow as no urgent bugs have been encountered. Big thanks to the devs, the auditors and all the community testers the last 3 months. Please continue reporting any Interface errors or UX issues in the #üö®Ô∏±tech-support channel and if you find a Smart Contract bug please report responsibility to @SmartAgents or @Maxwell_Smart_Agent for your rewards : ) Keep being awesome.

@everyone Update at the start of Day 2 of the Morpheus Fair Launch.

**Status:**
So far 32,572 stETH have been staked into the Capital Provider Smart Contract. 
This stETH yield will offer a great deal of liquidity for Coders, Compute, and Community to extend the Morpheus tech and network.
https://morpheus.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/capital Dashboard is looking good.

**Multisig Addresses:**
As planned, the Morpheus Smart Contracts have been transferred to the Multisig addresses for both Ethereum & Arbitrum.
Multisig Address for Ethereum: 0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E
Multisig Address for Arbitrum: 0x151c2b49CdEC10B150B2763dF3d1C00D70C90956

You can validate the owner of the Smart Contracts going to Etherscan by Clicking "Contract", Click "Read As Proxy" and Click "Owner".
See image attached. List of Smart Contracts.

Ethereum:
Distribution: https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
L1Sender: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2Efd4430489e1a05A89c2f51811aC661B7E5FF84

Arbitrum:
L2TokenReceiver: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790
L2MessageReceiver: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd4a8ECcBe696295e68572A98b1aA70Aa9277d427
MOR: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7431aDa8a591C955a994a21710752EF9b882b8e3
Note for the MOR token contract its owner is L2MessageReceiver.

**Next Upgrades**
Based on good community suggestions there are a set of upgrades to be developed by the open source devs next to improve the Dashboard and Smart Contracts. These are:
1. Prepare code for transition to the MOR.ETH ENS domain.
2. Add "wallet connect" to give users options beyond Meta Mask.
3. Add a recipient field when user claims MOR.
4. Outputting stETH accidentally sent directly to the Contract Address to a smart contract to return to senders.
5. Add switches between testnet and mainnet.

Have a great weekend everyone!

As Day 2 of the Morpheus Fair Launch finishes up its has been truly amazing to see the support from this community.
Contributions have crossed 40,000 stETH (over $100 Million in USD value)

Consider how all these Capital Providers are adding LIQUIDITY to the Network. 
Plus bootstrapping all the Coders, Compute Providers and Community Builders to expand the Morpheus platform.

Consider what this means for holding MOR over time. 
How scarce it will be. The level of competition to earn it.
Plus the utility it offers users to access an ever greater amount of Compute / Inference / Intelligence over time.

Keep being awesome friends.

@everyone Today is a exciting day for the Morpheus Community.

@Ishshogun @domsteil @ra6e Lochsbagel @Maxwell_Smart_Agent and other open source devs have built the first Smart Agent on Morpheus via the experimental 0.0.6 version. 
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/tree/0.0.6-beta
Still in testing. You can compile from source code. Still being packaged into an easy install.

See images attached. 
The local LLM interprets the intent of the request (using Smart Rank). 
Creates / stages the transaction. 
Prompts Meta Mask and asks for the user's review and approval. Amazing first.

# stETH and MOR Token FAQ
As day 7 of the Morpheus Fair Launch approaches its best to address some frequently asked questions here so there is an easy place to point people for answers.

## The most common questions are:

1. Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus beyond day 7?
**YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 7. **
**Every day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards.**

2. Can I continue staking my stETH in Morpheus past day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
**YES. You can keep staking your stETH after day 90. Every extra day you keep your stETH deposited you earn additional MOR rewards. In fact the Capital Provider reward in Morpheus goes for the entire ~16 year period of the initial supply curve. So keep earning MOR as long as you like : )**

3. When can I withdraw my stETH?
**Depends on when you deposited them.**
**The Smart Contract allows Capital Providers to withdraw 7 days from the time of their individual deposit.**

4. Can I deposit additional stETH?
**YES. You can make additional deposits of stETH when ever you like. 
Each deposit can be withdrawn after 7 days or longer.**

5. When can I claim the MOR I earned?
**The MOR tokens are claimable / sendable on day 90 (May 8th 2024). Don't be fooled by anyone offering to sell MOR before May 8th 2024. There is no pre-mine, there are no team tokens. The only MOR that exist are those fairly earned.**

6. How many MOR will I earn for depositing stETH?
**This is hard to predict so early on. However there is a website a community member put up that tries to run some of these estimates / calculations. https://morstats.info/ ** 
Credit to @chasingdreams 

7. What can I use MOR tokens for when I can claim it?
**The first utility of MOR will be to access Inference / Compute for running Smart Agents. Every person that holds MOR will get a pro-rata amount of access to the Compute offered to the Morpheus network. Think of it as Staking or Hodling for Inference or Intelligence : ) See Yellowstone paper for details. This aspect is still under development, but very actively being worked on by many open source devs.** https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

**Secondly, holding MOR may have lot of other benefits related to projects launching on the Morpheus Techno Capital Machine. As Smart Agents launch on Morpheus and use the same fair launch approach providing MOR yield to these projects is a very interesting way to support more open source projects to use the same staking Smart Contracts and best practices developed by the Morpheus community. See paper here.** https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/7.Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md

8. Is it better to provide stETH to earn MOR or buy them on Uniswap day 90 (May 8th 2024)?
**While there is a lot of discussion about this question, its impossible to predict as this point. However there is little downside to just doing BOTH. Everyone can earn MOR from their stETH and then on day 90 if MOR is cheap on Uniswap you can always withdraw your stETH and trade it for MOR. **

Oh and there are now 60,000+ stETH staked to the Morpheus Smart Contracts. 
Amazing to see all the passion for Decentralized AI. Keeping being awesome.

@everyone 
Thanks to @antonb | will not DM you for creating a great Morpheus Meetup Guide.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Meetup%20Guide/12.%20Morpheus%20Meetup%20Guide.md

This is a easy template for hosting the first Morpheus Meetup in your area. There is a full list of tech cities across the world that qualify for a few hours of credit (from the Coder reward). Credit goes to the local community member who wants to host the first Meetup in their city.

Anyone can host a Morpheus Meetup and if local Capital, Code, Compute or Community Builders find it useful, then the goal is to create a space for people to start meeting in person on a regular basis, in order to expand the Morpheus community especially among Web3 developers and Smart Agent builders.

Check out the steps in the Guide, consider becoming a Meetup host. Excited to see Meetups spread across the world.

# Community Public Announcement 
As the community grows quickly, please be careful of scammers! 
As some folks reported scam attempts recently. 
Here is what each member should know not to get scammed and lose your funds:

**Accelerators will never DM you with any links.**
All the real links are available in ‚Å†üìöÔ∏±#verified-links channel. 

There are:
‚ùå NO raffles
‚ùå NO airdrops
‚ùå NO token sale
‚ùå NO private sale
‚ùå NO whitelists
‚ùå NO private token allocations
‚ùå NO NFTs
‚ùå NO OTC deals 
‚ùå NO tech support team (everyone who message you proposing help, likely scammer)
‚ùå NO mails from Morpheus

MOR token will NOT be transferable and claimable until May 9th (date may slightly change) that respectively implies:
‚ùå you can't buy MOR
‚ùå you can't sell MOR
‚ùå you can't send MOR
‚ùå you can't receive MOR to your address
‚ùå you can't claim MOR

What you CAN do during 90 days after launch called bootstrapping period:
‚úÖ  deposit stETH into the contract and be rewarded in MOR proportionally to your contribution as Capital Provider
‚úÖ  provide code to Morpheus Github and be rewarded in MOR

üëÄ  Be cautious and check everything twice! 
‚ùì If you not sure in any aspect related to Morpheus - ask. Community is friendly and happy to help.

# Friday Status Update:
Happy Friday! The Morpheus community continues to grow. The Capital Provider Smart Contract is approaching 4,000 transactions. With the average person each adding a single deposit transaction, this metric is a good rough proxy for how many people have joined the Morpheus community the first 9 days of the fair launch. 

After the withdraw function went live on day 7, there was a significant increase in stETH deposits and generally the inflows of stETH continued to outpace withdraws ever since.

The community has generated a lot of cool websites and resources to look at all the data and stats from the Morpheus fair launch. Highlighting a couple of the best links here.

# Morpheus Github Reorganization

Github has been reorganized today into 9 more focused repositories for Docs, MRCs, TCM, Node, Morpheus, Dashboard, Smart Contracts, Smart Agents & Morpheus Linux. 

All the papers, contributions, and technical documents have been moved to the "Docs" repository, so please direct Code Contributions to that repo going forward. https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md

If you find any broken website links to Github as a result DM me and I'll direct the feedback to the open source dev it effects.
- Mor.org updated :Check: 
- MorpheusAI.org updated :Check: 
- Dashboard updated :Check:  - Clear your cookies if a link doesn't work.

Thanks to @antonb | will not DM you @The Oracle and @Maxwell_Smart_Agent

# Coders Dashboard at Mor.Software
Website: https://mor.software/

Big thanks to @Maxwell_Smart_Agent for building a Coders Dashboard for the developer community to use.

This will make it a lot easier for Developers who want to get involved in providing Code Contributions to Morpheus.
Just click the "Register as a Developer" button, then input your Github handle and Ethereum address and other info and the Dashboard will create you a "MOR DEV ID". These DEV IDs will be included in pull requests related to Code Contributions starting in the March snapshot of Code Contributors. 

The Dashboard will also start connecting in Issues and existing known Coding needs so it makes it easier for devs to find what needs to be worked on next. Later it the Dashboard will provide a way for Devs to check their weights recorded in the monthly Coding snapshots and the resulting MOR they have earned and can be claimed at their address. 

## Code Contributor Guide To Earning Weights & Their Implied Value
In a related effort to make it easier for developers to understand how to bid on providing code and the value of the coding "weights" they earn and how that translates into MOR tokens I've written this guide and added it to Github.
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/English%20Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md

One change worth noting is that the term "hours" proved very confusing as it was meant as proxy for weights / value contributed to the Coding Contributions not literal hours. So hours as a term has been replaced by "weights". Hopefully the guide will make it clear on how to think about the potential value of these weights and how that is determined by the free market based on the amount of stETH contributed and after May 8th the free market price of MOR / wETH.

## Morpheus Reference Implementations
One of the common questions lately has been how the Coding rewards work, what areas need to be developed next and who is best to talk with about each aspect of Morpheus. So I've created this diagram of the 10 "Morpheus Reference Implementations" (MRIs) are being built and by whom.

## List of Existing Morpheus Reference Implementations
1. Smart Contracts on Ethereum / Arbitrum
2. Smart Agents Tools & Examples
3. Morpheus Local Install Desktop / Mobile
4. TCM / MOR20 Token Standard for Fair Launches
5. Protection Fund
## List of New Morpheus Reference Implementations
6. Capital Proofs Extended beyond Lido stETH
7. Compute Proofs Morpheus / Lumerin
8. Code Proofs & Dashboards
9. Frontend Proofs & Examples
10. Interoperability
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Reference%20Implementations.md

## Estimating Morpheus Coder Weight Values
The second aspect is for Coders once they know where to contribute, to understand the value of the Coding weights they earn. The developer of Morstats.info has extended his interface to include projection of Coder weight values.
https://morstats.info/code-weights/

## Weight Emissions Schedule & Proposed Supply Cap of 50,000 
The weights earned by Coders are only valuable if they are scarce. So to offer clarity on the estimate for the number of Coder weights that will exist lets presume there is a cap of 50 thousand weights the end of the Coder reward period (16 years).

https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/English%20Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#weights-emissions-schedule--supply-cap

Morpheus Capital Providers cross $415,000,000 USD of stETH staked to Morpheus.

Incredible milestone for the project. The $100,000,000+ USD of worth per week so far. 

Ethereum has proven a great foundation from which to start building Morpheus. 
Just the beginning. Let's keep building friends.

## New Dashboard Improvements & MOR.ETH ENS Connection In Testing

Two important improvements in testing right now.

1. The "Wallet Connect" option has been added to the Capital Contributor Dashboard. You can test it out at this link. Report any bugs on the  #üö®Ô∏±tech-support channel. 
https://morpheus-dev.206.189.243.3.sslip.io/#/mainnet/capital

2. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) address for the Morpheus Dashboard is now live for testing MOR.ETH https://mor.eth/ which resolves to this IPFS link: ipfs://bafybeigseyyspeqqwn6jowefx23yvgrmndsftospsowajzfyowfl5hc76q/#/mainnet/capital Again please report any bugs to Report any bugs on the  #üö®Ô∏±tech-support channel.

The capital flows into the Morpheus Smart Contract continue to grow now over 115,000 + stETH worth over $400 Million USD. These upgrades should continue to increase the ease of how Capital Providers join the Morpheus community. Thanks to the Smart Contract devs for their work on these improvements.

# Upgrading the Morpheus Dashboard's URL.

The ENS for MOR.ETH now resolves to:
ipfs://bafybeihqbac4d4n5agoun7tnqlmmy2wu372i5h57xz6g36koyfh7eiqr4e/#/mainnet/capital

Works best on Brave Browser : )

# MRC Improvements Proposed & Discord MRC Forum Launched

There has been a great deal of activity this week on the Morpheus Requests for Comment (MRCs). 
There are now 26+ proposals for ways to improve the 10 Morpheus Reference Implementations. 
https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC

Many of these MRCs are setting the stage to extend the Morpheus community to multiple chains, many types of yield, and enabling others to leverage the fair launch MOR20 Smart Contracts that Morpheus has pioneered.

Credit to @antonb | will not DM you for creating a great MRC forum here on Discord for these discussions to take place. https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1218593251079094383

# Morpheus 0.0.6 Version Release Notes: Mac + Linux + Windows Installs
This is the first version of Morpheus that brings together an open source LLM (defaults to Llama2) + connecting a user's Meta Mask wallet + executing on chain transactions via a ETH focused Smart Agent. Big thanks to @Maxwell_Smart_Agent @domsteil @lachsbagel @Ishshogun @jabo38. @TigerBuidl @antonb | will not DM you @Christopher  (Morpheus) @Helios @Mysticmarks and the many other coders and testers who contributed to this release.

## After connecting Morpheus to your Meta Mask, you can test it by taking basic actions such as:
"What is my balance?"
"What is my address?"
"Send ETH to Ethereum Address"

Morpheus doesn't have a connection to a block explorer or price oracles yet, so it can't answer general transactions questions. It just answers the above examples based on info from the Meta Mask wallet you connect.

## Warnings:
- Review all transactions before approving them. The LLM makes mistakes, you have human wisdom.
- Seriously, double check all actions in the Meta Mask interface before sending money.
- This is an experimental release and the ETH Smart Agent may try and send your money into a black hole. 
- Gas costs are high on Ethereum. Consider testing out 0.0.6 using the Sepolia testnet or Arbitrum.

# New Morpheus Dashboard URL For Web2 Style Browsers: Dashboard.Mor.org

Mor.org one of the most popular community websites for Morpheus has created a new link to the Morpheus Dashboard.
https://dashboard.mor.org/#/mainnet/capital

This will make it easy for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and other Web2 style browser users to access the Dashboard.

The MOR.ETH ENS address will continue to also host the Morpheus Dashboard, however given its ENS / Web3 / IPFS usage it only resolves for users of the Brave Browser.
